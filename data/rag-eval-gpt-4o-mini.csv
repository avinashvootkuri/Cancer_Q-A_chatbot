                    There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with anal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat anal cancer.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.        Surgery            -  Local resection: A surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection.     -  Abdominoperineal resection: A surgical procedure in which the anus, the rectum, and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen. The doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening, called a stoma, made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a colostomy. Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation.
                
                
                    Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer.
                    Cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For this reason, patients who have anal cancer and HIV are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have HIV.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Clinical trials are designed to test new cancer treatments, which may be more effective or have fewer side effects compared to standard treatments. Here are the specific benefits:

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may have the opportunity to receive new treatments that are not yet available to the general population. These can include innovative drugs, combinations of therapies, or entirely new approaches to treatment.

2. **Improvement in Standard Treatments**: Many standard treatments today are based on previous clinical trial findings. By participating in a trial, patients contribute to research that can lead to improved treatment protocols for future patients.

3. **Comprehensive Monitoring**: Clinical trials often include extensive follow-up tests and monitoring, which can provide patients with closer attention from healthcare professionals and potentially identify issues early.

4. **Participation in Research**: Patients taking part in clinical trials contribute to the advancement of medical knowledge and may help others with anal cancer in the future. Even if the new treatment does not prove effective, it often answers critical scientific questions that can guide future research.

5. **Variety of Clinical Trials**: Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment, offering flexibility based on their unique circumstances and stage of the disease.

Overall, being part of a clinical trial can be a proactive step for anal cancer patients seeking to explore cutting-edge treatment options that may enhance their outlook and quality of life.",605,"What are the potential benefits of participating in a clinical trial for anal cancer patients, especially in terms of exploring new treatment options?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the potential benefits of participating in clinical trials for anal cancer patients, emphasizing new treatment options, access to innovative therapies, and the role of clinical trial research in improving standards of care.

                    Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.
                    The skin is the bodys largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells:         -  Squamous cells: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis.    -  Basal cells: Round cells under the squamous cells.    -  Melanocytes: Cells that make melanin and are found in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken.          Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.
                
                
                    There are different types of cancer that start in the skin.
                    The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is a much rarer type of skin cancer. It is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Actinic keratosis is a skin condition that sometimes becomes squamous cell carcinoma.   This summary is about nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. See the following PDQ summaries for information on melanoma and other kinds of cancer that affect the skin:         -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment     -   Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment     -  Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment     -  Genetics of Skin Cancer
                
                
                    Nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis often appear as a change in the skin.
                    Not all changes in the skin are a sign of nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis. Check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your skin.    Signs of nonmelanoma skin cancer include the following:         - A sore that does not heal.    - Areas of the skin that are:               - Raised, smooth, shiny, and look pearly.       - Firm and look like a scar, and may be white, yellow, or waxy.      - Raised, and red or reddish-brown.       - Scaly, bleeding or crusty.","The different types of skin cancer that originate in the epidermis are:

1. **Basal Cell Carcinoma**: This is the most common type of skin cancer and typically occurs in areas sun-exposed, such as the nose. It often appears as a smooth and pearly raised bump or a flat scar-like lesion. Basal cell carcinoma may spread to surrounding tissues but usually does not metastasize to other parts of the body.

2. **Squamous Cell Carcinoma**: This cancer arises from squamous cells and can occur on sun-exposed areas like the ears, lower lip, and hands. It often appears as a firm red bump that may be scaly, bleed, or crust. Squamous cell carcinoma can spread to nearby lymph nodes, but if detected early, it is often curable.

3. **Actinic Keratosis**: While this is a precancerous condition rather than a type of cancer, it can sometimes progress to squamous cell carcinoma. It presents as rough, scaly patches and occurs on sun-exposed skin.

In summary, basal cell carcinoma typically remains localized and rarely spreads, while squamous cell carcinoma has a higher tendency to spread to nearby lymph nodes. Actinic keratosis is a precursor to possible squamous cell carcinoma but is not a cancer itself.",112,"What are the different types of skin cancer that originate in the epidermis, and how do they differ in terms of their likelihood to spread to other parts of the body?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the types of skin cancer that originate in the epidermis, specifically basal cell carcinoma, squamous cell carcinoma, and actinic keratosis.

                    - The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.
                
                
                    The plan for cancer treatment depends on whether the tumor is in one area of the brain or has spread all through the brain.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    There is no standard staging system for childhood brain stem glioma. Treatment is based on the following:         - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has come back after treatment).    - The type of tumor (either a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma or a focal glioma).","When diagnosing whether a childhood brain stem glioma is newly diagnosed or recurrent, the following factors are considered:

1. **Treatment History**: The classification depends on whether the tumor is one for which no treatment has been given (newly diagnosed) or if it has come back after treatment (recurrent).

2. **Type of Tumor**: The assessment also involves identifying whether the tumor is a diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma (DIPG) or a focal glioma, as the treatment and staging differ for these types.

3. **Imaging Tests**: Follow-up imaging may be required to confirm if a mass seen in the brain is a recurrence or remains a residual effect of the previous tumor or treatment.

In summary, diagnosis takes into account the treatment status, type of tumor, and findings from imaging tests.",411,What factors are considered when diagnosing whether a childhood brain stem glioma is newly diagnosed or recurrent?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question about factors for diagnosing a childhood brain stem glioma as newly diagnosed or recurrent, which is related to the original answer. However, while it provides relevant factors such as treatment history and tumor type, it does not fully encompass the entire context of the original answer, which also discusses the staging process and relevance to treatment planning."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - Where the tumor has formed in the central nervous system (CNS).    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes or chromosomes.    - Whether any cancer cells remain after surgery to remove the tumor.     - The type of ependymoma.     - The age of the child when the tumor is diagnosed.     - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the brain or spinal cord.     - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).         Prognosis also depends on the type and dose of radiation therapy that is given.,"The prognosis and treatment for newly diagnosed versus recurrent childhood ependymoma can differ significantly. 

For newly diagnosed childhood ependymoma, treatment typically begins with surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Depending on various factors such as the amount of tumor remaining post-surgery, the presence of cancer spread, and the child's age, further treatments may include radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or participation in clinical trials. The treatment plan is tailored based on whether the tumor is completely removed, partially removed, or has spread.

In contrast, treatment for recurrent childhood ependymoma usually involves more aggressive approaches. Options may include surgery to remove the recurrent tumor if feasible, radiation therapy—which may involve more advanced techniques like stereotactic radiosurgery or intensity-modulated radiation therapy—and chemotherapy. Additionally, participation in clinical trials exploring new treatments may be a viable option for these patients.

The prognosis for recurrent ependymoma is generally less favorable compared to newly diagnosed cases, as recurrence indicates that the cancer has returned despite initial treatment efforts. Factors influencing prognosis include the specifics of the recurrence, such as location and type of tumor, as well as the child's overall health and response to prior treatments.",165,What differences in prognosis and treatment might exist between newly diagnosed versus recurrent ependymoma in children?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed comparison of prognosis and treatment options for newly diagnosed versus recurrent ependymoma in children, aligning closely with the factors mentioned in the original answer. It addresses key aspects like the type of treatment, the impact of remaining tumor post-surgery, age of the child, and differences in prognosis, which are all relevant to the original context."

                    After a childhood extracranial germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread from where the tumor started to nearby areas or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread from where the tumor started to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. In some cases, staging may follow surgery to remove the tumor.    The following procedures may be used:         -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.    -   Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.    -   Paracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the abdomen and the organs in the abdomen, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.        The results from tests and procedures used to detect and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may also be used in staging.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if an extracranial germ cell tumor spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually cancerous germ cells. The disease is metastatic extracranial germ cell tumor, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    Stages are used to describe the different types of extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    Childhood nonseminoma testicular germ cell tumors            -  Stage I: In stage I, the cancer is found in the testicle only and is completely removed by surgery.     -  Stage II: In stage II, the cancer is removed by surgery and some cancer cells remain in the scrotum or cancer that can be seen with a microscope only has spread to the scrotum or spermatic cord. Tumor marker levels do not return to normal after surgery or the tumor marker levels increase.     -  Stage III: In stage III, the cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen and is not completely removed by surgery. The cancer that remains after surgery can be seen without a microscope.     -  Stage IV: In stage IV, the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body such as the liver, brain, bone, or lung.              Childhood ovarian germ cell tumors     There are two types of stages used for childhood ovarian germ cell tumors. The following stages are from the Children's Oncology Group:            -  Stage I: In stage I, the cancer is in the ovary and can be completely removed by surgery and the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has not ruptured (broken open).     -  Stage II: In stage II, one of the following is true:                   - The cancer is not completely removed by surgery. The remaining cancer can be seen with a microscope only.       - The cancer has spread to the lymph nodes and can be seen with a microscope only.       - The cancer has spread to the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary.                -  Stage III: In stage III, one of the following is true:                  - The cancer is not completely removed by surgery. The remaining cancer can be seen without a microscope.       - The cancer has spread to lymph nodes and the lymph nodes are 2 centimeters or larger. Cancer in the lymph nodes can be seen without a microscope.       - The cancer is found in fluid in the abdomen.                -  Stage IV: In stage IV, the cancer has spread to the lung, liver, brain, or bone.            The following stages are from the International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO):            -  Stage I: In stage I, cancer is found in one or both of the ovaries and has not spread. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.                   - Stage IA: Cancer is found in one ovary.       - Stage IB: Cancer is found in both ovaries.       - Stage IC: Cancer is found in one or both ovaries and one of the following is true:                           - cancer is found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or          - the capsule (outer covering) of the tumor has ruptured (broken open); or           - cancer cells are found in fluid that has collected in the abdomen; or          - cancer cells are found in washings of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen).                                 -  Stage II: In stage II, cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC.                   - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes (the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus).        - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to other tissue within the pelvis such as the bladder, rectum, or vagina.        - Stage IIC: Cancer has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes and/or other tissue within the pelvis and one of the following is true:                           - cancer is found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or          - the capsule (outer covering) of the tumor has ruptured (broken open); or           - cancer cells are found in fluid that has collected in the abdomen; or          - cancer cells are found in washings of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen).                                 -  Stage III: In stage III, cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has spread to other parts of the abdomen. Cancer that has spread to the surface of the liver is also stage III disease. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC:                   - Stage IIIA: The tumor is found in the pelvis only, but cancer cells that can only be seen with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum (tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen) or to the small bowel.        - Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum and is 2 centimeters or smaller in diameter.       - Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum and is larger than 2 centimeters in diameter and/or has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen.                -  Stage IV: In stage IV, cancer is found in one or both ovaries and has metastasized (spread) beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body. Cancer that has spread to tissues in the liver is also stage IV disease.              Childhood extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors            -  Stage I: In stage I, the cancer is in one place and can be completely removed by surgery. For tumors in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine), the sacrum and coccyx are completely removed by surgery. Tumor marker levels return to normal after surgery.      -  Stage II: In stage II, the cancer has spread to the capsule (outer covering) and/or lymph nodes. The cancer is not completely removed by surgery and the cancer remaining after surgery can be seen with a microscope only. Tumor marker levels do not return to normal after surgery or increase.     -  Stage III: In stage III, one of the following is true:                  - The cancer is not completely removed by surgery. The cancer remaining after surgery can be seen without a microscope.       - The cancer has spread to lymph nodes and is larger than 2 centimeters in diameter.                -  Stage IV: In stage IV, the cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, including the liver, brain, bone, or lung.","Childhood nonseminoma testicular germ cell tumors are classified by their stages as follows:

- **Stage I:** In this stage, the cancer is found in the testicle only and is completely removed by surgery.
  
- **Stage II:** Here, the cancer is removed by surgery, but some cancer cells remain in the scrotum, or cancer that can only be seen under a microscope has spread to the scrotum or spermatic cord. Additionally, tumor marker levels do not return to normal after surgery or show an increase.
  
- **Stage III:** In this stage, the cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen and is not completely removed by surgery. The remaining cancer can be seen without a microscope.
  
- **Stage IV:** In this final stage, the cancer has metastasized to distant parts of the body, including areas like the liver, brain, bone, or lung. 

The staging process is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment plan for the patient.",109,Can you explain how childhood nonseminoma testicular germ cell tumors are classified by their stages?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the classification of childhood nonseminoma testicular germ cell tumors by their stages, accurately reflecting the information provided in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage lip and oral cavity cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam of the lips and oral cavity: An exam to check the lips and oral cavity for abnormal areas. The medical doctor or dentist will feel the entire inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the oral cavity with a small long-handled mirror and lights. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the roof and floor of the mouth; and the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue. The neck will be felt for swollen lymph nodes. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and medical and dental treatments will also be taken.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If leukoplakia is found, cells taken from the patches are also checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Exfoliative cytology : A procedure to collect cells from the lip or oral cavity. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the lips, tongue, mouth, or throat. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   Barium swallow : A series of x-rays of the esophagus and stomach. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called an upper GI series.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.","The significance of a biopsy in the diagnosis of oral cavity cancer, particularly in relation to leukoplakia, lies in its role in assessing abnormal tissue. When leukoplakia, which manifests as white patches of cells that do not rub off, is observed, a biopsy is conducted to remove cells or tissues from these patches. The removed samples are then examined under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. This process is critical, as squamous cell carcinoma, a type of oral cavity cancer, often develops in areas of leukoplakia. Therefore, the biopsy helps determine whether the leukoplakia is benign or potentially malignant, guiding further diagnosis and management of the condition.",392,"What is the significance of a biopsy in the diagnosis of oral cavity cancer, particularly in relation to leukoplakia?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the significance of a biopsy in the diagnosis of oral cavity cancer and specifically relates it to leukoplakia, which is a topic mentioned in the original answer. It accurately describes the role of a biopsy in assessing abnormal tissue and its importance in determining the potential malignancy of leukoplakia, thereby aligning well with the original content."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The patients age.    - The phase of CML.    - The amount of blasts in the blood or bone marrow.    - The size of the spleen at diagnosis.    - The patients general health.,"The size of the spleen at diagnosis is considered an important factor in determining the outlook for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) because it is one of the factors that affect prognosis, or the chance of recovery. An enlarged spleen, known as splenomegaly, may indicate a more advanced stage of the disease or a higher burden of leukemia cells in the body. Thus, assessing the size of the spleen at diagnosis can provide crucial information for evaluating the severity of the disease and planning appropriate treatment options.",573,Why is the size of the spleen at diagnosis considered an important factor in determining the outlook for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of spleen size at diagnosis, linking it to prognosis and treatment options for Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia as mentioned in the original answer. It elaborates on the implications of spleen size, which enhances the understanding of its relevance in the context provided."

                    - Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts.     - Having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer.    - Signs of bile duct cancer include jaundice and pain in the abdomen.    - Tests that examine the bile ducts and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer.    - Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer.     - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts.
                    A network of tubes, called ducts, connects the liver, gallbladder, and small intestine. This network begins in the liver where many small ducts collect bile (a fluid made by the liver to break down fats during digestion). The small ducts come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the common hepatic duct. Bile from the liver passes through the hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, and cystic duct and is stored in the gallbladder.    When food is being digested, bile stored in the gallbladder is released and passes through the cystic duct to the common bile duct and into the small intestine.    Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma.   There are two types of bile duct cancer:         -   Intrahepatic bile duct cancer : This type of cancer forms in the bile ducts inside the liver. Only a small number of bile duct cancers are intrahepatic. Intrahepatic bile duct cancers are also called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.    -   Extrahepatic bile duct cancer : The extrahepatic bile duct is made up of the hilum region and the distal region. Cancer can form in either region:                - Perihilar bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the hilum region, the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. Perihilar bile duct cancer is also called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.      - Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the distal region. The distal region is made up of the common bile duct which passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer is also called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","To detect and stage bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma), various diagnostic tests and procedures are employed. These include:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: An assessment of overall health and previous health issues.
2. **Liver Function Tests**: Blood tests checking for bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase levels, which may indicate liver disease related to bile duct cancer.
3. **Laboratory Tests**: Testing samples of tissue, blood, or urine to assist in diagnosing the disease.
4. **Tumor Marker Tests**: Such as the carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 tests, which measure substances linked to specific cancers in the body.
5. **Imaging Tests**:
   - **Ultrasound Exam**: Uses sound waves to produce images of the abdomen's internal structures.
   - **CT Scan (CAT Scan)**: Generates detailed images of internal organs using x-ray technology.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Provides detailed pictures of body structures using magnetic fields and radio waves.
   - **MRCP (Magnetic Resonance Cholangiopancreatography)**: Focuses on imaging the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, and pancreatic duct.

To obtain tissue samples for diagnosis, several biopsy procedures may be utilized:

1. **Laparoscopy**: A surgical method where small incisions are made, and a thin, lighted tube is inserted to examine internal organs and take tissue samples.
2. **Percutaneous Transhepatic Cholangiography (PTC)**: Involves inserting a needle through the skin into the liver to inject dye for imaging and removes tissue samples for analysis.
3. **Endoscopic Retrograde Cholangiopancreatography (ERCP)**: Uses an endoscope to inject dye into the bile ducts and enables tissue sampling to investigate for cancer signs.

These combined testing and biopsy methods provide a comprehensive approach to diagnosing and staging bile duct cancer.",577,"What types of diagnostic tests and procedures are utilized to detect and stage bile duct cancer, and how are tissue samples obtained for diagnosis?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the diagnostic tests and procedures used to detect and stage bile duct cancer, as well as how tissue samples are obtained for diagnosis.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.   For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the baby. Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes, the stage of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the age of the baby. The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in treating blood cancers. The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and are experts in treating adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Neurosurgeon.    -  Neurologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    - Other oncology specialists.
                
                
                    Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects.    Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:          - Heart problems.    -  Infertility (inability to have children).    - Loss of bone density.    -  Neuropathy (nerve damage that causes numbness or trouble walking).    - A second cancer, such as:               -  Lung cancer.      - Brain cancer.      -  Kidney cancer.      -  Bladder cancer.      -  Melanoma.      -  Hodgkin lymphoma.      -  Myelodysplastic syndrome.      -  Acute myeloid leukemia.                 Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular follow-up to check for late effects is important.
                
                
                    Nine types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Total-body irradiation is a type of external radiation therapy that is given to the entire body. It may be given before a stem cell transplant.    The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.    For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the baby. If treatment is needed right away, pregnant women may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. However, lead used to shield the baby may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs. Steroid drugs may be added, to lessen inflammation and lower the body's immune response.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.     Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of lymphoma that first forms in the testicles or sinuses (hollow areas) around the nose, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and some aggressive T-cell lymphomas. It is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord. This is called CNS prophylaxis.     In pregnant women, the baby is exposed to chemotherapy when the mother is treated, and some anticancer drugs cause birth defects. Because anticancer drugs are passed to the baby through the mother, both must be watched closely when chemotherapy is given.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.     Immunomodulators are a type of immunotherapy. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy, proteasome inhibitor therapy, and kinase inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies that have been joined to radioactive material are called radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Yttrium Y 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan is an example of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.     Proteasome inhibitor therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors.    Kinase inhibitor therapy, such as idelalisib, blocks certain proteins, which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them. It is used to treat indolent lymphoma. Ibrutinib, a type of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, is used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Plasmapheresis    If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.        Watchful waiting      Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.        Antibiotic therapy     Antibiotic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat infections and cancer caused by bacteria and other microorganisms.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Surgery     Surgery may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body:            - Local excision for certain patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, PTLD, and small bowel T-cell lymphoma.     -  Splenectomy for patients with marginal zone lymphoma of the spleen.           Patients who have a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas transplant usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term immunosuppression after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PLTD).    Small bowel surgery is often needed to diagnose celiac disease in adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma.       Stem cell transplant    Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous transplant) or a donor (allogeneic transplant) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Vaccine therapy     Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

						                    Treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy may include the following:         - Treatment given right away based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to increase the mother's chance of survival. Treatment may include combination chemotherapy and rituximab.    - Early delivery of the baby followed by treatment based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    - If in the first trimester of pregnancy, medical oncologists may advise ending the pregnancy so that treatment may begin. Treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","Chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma is administered through systemic and regional approaches, each affecting the treatment's effectiveness differently. 

**Systemic chemotherapy** is delivered via oral routes or injected into a vein or muscle, allowing the drugs to enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body. This method is commonly used as it targets cancer cells regardless of their location, making it useful for widespread disease.

**Regional chemotherapy** involves the direct administration of chemotherapy drugs into cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), organs, or body cavities (such as the abdomen), primarily affecting cancer cells in those specific areas. This approach is utilized to tailor treatment for localized cancer, reducing systemic exposure and potentially minimizing side effects.

The implications of these different methods on treatment effectiveness depend on factors such as the type, stage, and location of the lymphoma. Systemic chemotherapy is generally more advantageous for aggressive forms of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that may have metastasized. In contrast, regional chemotherapy can be effective for cancers confined to specific regions, particularly when there’s a risk of central nervous system involvement. The oncologist's choice between these methods is based on detailed staging and the patient's overall health profile, aiming for the most effective strategy in managing the disease.",353,"How is chemotherapy administered for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in terms of systemic versus regional approaches, and what implications does this have for treatment effectiveness?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the methods of administering chemotherapy for non-Hodgkin lymphoma, specifically differentiating between systemic and regional approaches.

                    After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually GIST cells. The disease is metastatic GIST, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment.
                    For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment. However, the treatment of GIST is not based on the stage of the cancer. Treatment is based on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread to other parts of the abdomen or to distant parts of the body.    Treatment is based on whether the tumor is:         -  Resectable: These tumors can be removed by surgery .    -  Unresectable: These tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery.    -  Metastatic and recurrent: Metastatic tumors have spread to other parts of the body. Recurrent tumors have recurred (come back) after treatment. Recurrent GISTs may come back in the gastrointestinal tract or in other parts of the body. They are usually found in the abdomen, peritoneum, and/or liver.    -  Refractory: These tumors have not gotten better with treatment.","The staging of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) is crucial in the management of the disease, as it helps determine whether cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body. However, the treatment planning for GISTs is primarily based not on the stage itself but rather on the resectability of the tumor, meaning whether it can be surgically removed, and whether it has metastasized.

The results from diagnostic and staging tests inform clinicians about the tumor's characteristics and extent, guiding decisions regarding the treatment approach. For example:
- **Resectable tumors** can be treated with surgery to remove the tumor and surrounding tissue.
- **Unresectable tumors** may require targeted therapy, such as imatinib mesylate, aimed at shrinking the tumor before potential surgical intervention.
- **Metastatic or recurrent tumors** are managed with targeted therapies and, if feasible, surgery to address complications or to remove tumor tissue.

Ultimately, while staging provides important information about tumor spread, treatment planning for GIST is more focused on the ability to remove the tumor and the current extent of disease rather than the numerical stage classification itself.",668,How does the staging of gastrointestinal stromal tumors impact the treatment planning for patients with this type of cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question regarding how the staging of gastrointestinal stromal tumors impacts treatment planning. It summarizes key points from the original answer, including the importance of staging in understanding tumor spread and the emphasis on tumor resectability and metastasis in treatment decisions, aligning well with the context of the original content."
"Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Age      Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.       Family history of prostate cancer     A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.       Race     Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.       Hormones    The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main male sex hormone is testosterone. Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.    Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.       Vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.       Folic acid    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.       Dairy and calcium    A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Folate    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.       Finasteride and Dutasteride     Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.    The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.    The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).
                
                
                    The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
                    Selenium and vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for African-American men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.       Diet    It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.       Multivitamins    Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.       Lycopene    Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.","The specific age range that sees the lowest incidence of prostate cancer is men younger than 50 years of age, as prostate cancer is rare in this group. The risk of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older, with about one out of five men diagnosed with prostate cancer in the United States being older men.",84,What specific age range sees the lowest incidence of prostate cancer and how does risk change with age?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the specific age range with the lowest incidence of prostate cancer (men younger than 50 years) and notes the increase in risk with age, which aligns well with the information provided in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the ovaries are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage ovarian low malignant potential tumor. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.Other patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     An operation may be done to remove the tumor. One of the following types of surgery may be used:            -  Enucleation: Surgery to remove the tumor only. This may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas.     -  Pancreatoduodenectomy: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. The organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient's condition. This is also called the Whipple procedure.     -  Distal pancreatectomy: Surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas. The spleen may also be removed.     - Total gastrectomy: Surgery to remove the whole stomach.     -  Parietal cell vagotomy: Surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid.     -  Liver resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the liver.     -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.      -  Cryosurgical ablation: A procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells. This is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide. The instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin. This procedure is also called cryoablation.               Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.       Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization     Hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver). This is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    Chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.    The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic NETs.       Supportive care     Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:            - Stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as:                  -  Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole.       - Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.       - Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.                -  Diarrhea may be treated with:                   -  Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride.        - Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.                - Low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level.     -  High blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    - Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.    - There are several types of skin cancer.    - Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.
                
                
                    Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.
                    The skin is the bodys largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer).     The epidermis is made up of 3 kinds of cells:         -  Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells that make up most of the epidermis.    -  Basal cells are the round cells under the squamous cells.    -  Melanocytes are found throughout the lower part of the epidermis. They make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken.        The dermis contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands.     See the following PDQ summaries for more information about skin cancer:         -  Skin Cancer Screening     -  Skin Cancer Treatment     -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Genetics of Skin Cancer
                
                
                    There are several types of skin cancer.
                    The most common types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, which forms in the squamous cells and basal cell carcinoma, which forms in the basal cells. Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancers. Melanoma, which forms in the melanocytes, is a less common type of skin cancer that grows and spreads quickly.    Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.
                
                
                    Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.
                    Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of skin cancer in the United States. The number of new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing every year. These nonmelanoma skin cancers can usually be cured.   The number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing for at least 30 years. Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Finding and treating melanoma skin cancer early may help prevent death from melanoma.","The structure of the skin plays a significant role in the development of skin cancer, particularly due to the different types of cells found in the epidermis. The epidermis, which is the outer layer of the skin, consists of three main types of cells:

1. **Squamous Cells:** These are thin, flat cells that form most of the epidermis. Skin cancer that develops in these cells is known as squamous cell carcinoma.

2. **Basal Cells:** Located beneath the squamous cells, these round cells can give rise to basal cell carcinoma, which is another common type of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

3. **Melanocytes:** Found in the lower part of the epidermis, these cells produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. When melanocytes become cancerous, the result is melanoma, which is a more aggressive form of skin cancer.

The epidermis is directly exposed to environmental factors, particularly ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sunlight. This exposure can lead to mutations in the DNA of the skin cells. For instance, prolonged UV exposure can cause DNA damage in the squamous and basal cells, leading to the formation of abnormal cells that may turn cancerous. Additionally, since the skin serves as a protective barrier, any disruption or injury to this layer may further allow cancerous cells to develop and potentially spread deeper into the skin or to other parts of the body. 

In summary, the composition and structure of the skin, particularly the presence of squamous cells, basal cells, and melanocytes in the epidermis, along with exposure to UV radiation, contribute significantly to the risk of developing skin cancer.",205,"How does the structure of the skin contribute to the development of skin cancer, particularly in relation to the different types of cells found in the epidermis?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the question about how the structure of the skin contributes to the development of skin cancer. It details the types of cells in the epidermis (squamous cells, basal cells, and melanocytes) and relates their roles to the types of skin cancer that can arise from them, which aligns closely with the key points provided in the original answer about skin cancer and its common types. Additionally, it discusses the impact of UV radiation on the cells, thereby expanding upon the information in the original answer while maintaining strong relevance."
"Age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for adult Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:         - Being in young or late adulthood.     - Being male.     - Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus.    - Having a first-degree relative (parent, brother, or sister) with Hodgkin lymphoma.        Pregnancy is not a risk factor for Hodgkin lymphoma.","There is no evidence to suggest that pregnancy has an impact on the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. According to the cancer database context, pregnancy is not listed as a risk factor for Hodgkin lymphoma, which indicates that pregnancy does not increase the likelihood of developing this disease. Furthermore, factors that are known to influence the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection, rather than pregnancy-related factors.",291,"Is there any evidence to suggest that pregnancy has an impact on the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma, and if not, why?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the impact of pregnancy on the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma, confirming that there is no evidence supporting such an impact.

"A child who has heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers. A child with heritable retinoblastoma has an increased risk of a pineal tumor in the brain. When retinoblastoma and a brain tumor occur at the same time, it is called trilateral retinoblastoma. The brain tumor is usually diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age. Regular screening using MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) may be done for a child thought to have heritable retinoblastoma or for a child with retinoblastoma in one eye and a family history of the disease. CT (computerized tomography) scans are usually not used for routine screening in order to avoid exposing the child to ionizing radiation.    Heritable retinoblastoma also increases the child's risk of other types of cancer such as lung cancer, bladder cancer, or melanoma in later years. Regular follow-up exams are important.","The risks associated with heritable retinoblastoma in children include:

1. Increased risk of trilateral retinoblastoma, which is when a child has retinoblastoma and a brain tumor at the same time, typically diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age.
2. Higher likelihood of developing other cancers later in life, including lung cancer, bladder cancer, or melanoma.
3. Specific increased risk of developing pineoblastoma, a type of brain tumor associated with heritable retinoblastoma.

Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The size of the tumor.    -  Where the tumor is in the anus.    - Whether the cancer has spread to the lymph nodes.        The treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    -  Where the tumor is in the anus.    - Whether the patient has human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).    - Whether cancer remains after initial treatment or has recurred.,"The location of the tumor within the anus significantly influences both treatment options and recovery chances for anal cancer. Here's how:

1. **Treatment Options**: 
   - The precise location of the tumor determines the treatment strategy. For example, tumors located near the rectum may require different surgical approaches compared to those situated further away. Furthermore, tumors that have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes (as in stages IIIA and IIIB) may necessitate more aggressive treatments, such as combination chemotherapy and targeted radiation, alongside surgery.

2. **Recovery Chances**:
   - The prognosis depends on where the tumor is in the anus. Tumors that are smaller and localized (e.g., Stage I) tend to have a better chance of recovery, while larger tumors (e.g., Stage II) or those that have spread to nearby lymph nodes or organs (e.g., Stage III) may present more challenges, thereby reducing recovery chances. The extent of spread at the time of diagnosis directly correlates with outcomes: localized tumors have higher survival rates compared to those that have metastasized (Stage IV).

In summary, the specific location of the tumor affects both the treatment modalities utilized and the overall prognosis for recovery from anal cancer.",602,In what ways does the location of the tumor within the anus influence both treatment options and recovery chances?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the important factors outlined in the original answer regarding how the tumor's location impacts both treatment options and chances of recovery.

                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.
                
                
                    Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia:          -  Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment.    -  Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment.    -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment.    -  Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment.","Lymphocytes play a crucial role in the development of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) by becoming the primary cells that proliferate abnormally in this condition. In adult ALL, the bone marrow produces an excess of lymphocytes, which are a type of white blood cell. This overproduction leads to a proliferation of immature lymphoid cells, specifically lymphoblasts, which do not function properly in fighting infections. These aberrant cells are also referred to as leukemia cells.

As the number of leukemia cells increases, they occupy space in the bone marrow and bloodstream, which reduces the availability of space for healthy blood components, including normal white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This overcrowding can result in various complications: a decreased number of healthy white blood cells increases the risk of infections, a reduction in red blood cells can lead to anemia (resulting in fatigue and weakness), and fewer platelets can cause easy bruising and bleeding. The combination of these effects significantly impacts overall health and can lead to serious medical conditions, complicating the management and treatment of the disease.",634,Can you explain the role of lymphocytes in the development of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia and how their abnormal production affects other blood components?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the role of lymphocytes in the development of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and details how their abnormal production affects other blood components.

                    Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.
                    The endometrium is the innermost lining of the uterus. The uterus is a hollow, muscular organ in a woman's pelvis. The uterus is where a fetus grows. In most nonpregnant women, the uterus is about 3 inches long.     Cancer of the endometrium is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called uterine sarcoma.

                    In the United States, endometrial cancer is the most common invasive cancer of the female reproductive system.
                    Endometrial cancer is diagnosed most often in postmenopausal women at an average age of 60 years.   From 2004 to 2013, the number of new cases of endometrial cancer increased slightly in white and black women. From 2005 to 2014, the number of deaths from endometrial cancer increased slightly in white and black women. When endometrial cancer is diagnosed in black women, it is usually more advanced and less likely to be cured.","Endometrial cancer and uterine sarcoma are distinct types of cancer that originate in different tissues of the uterus. 

**Endometrial Cancer**:
- This cancer develops in the tissues of the endometrium, which is the inner lining of the uterus.
- It is the most common invasive cancer of the female reproductive system.
- Typical symptoms may include unusual vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain.
- Factors such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, and certain hormonal treatments can increase the risk of developing endometrial cancer.

**Uterine Sarcoma**:
- Uterine sarcoma arises from the muscles of the uterus or the supportive tissues surrounding it.
- It is a rare form of cancer compared to endometrial cancer.
- Symptoms often include abnormal bleeding, which can also occur in other conditions.

**Distinction in Treatment Options**:
Treatments vary significantly for these two types of cancer based on their different origins:

1. **Endometrial Cancer**:
   - Treatment typically includes surgery to remove the uterus (hysterectomy) and possibly other therapies such as radiation, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy based on the stage and characteristics of the cancer.

2. **Uterine Sarcoma**:
   - Standard treatments involve surgery, which may be followed by chemotherapy or radiation therapy. Hormone therapy might also be considered depending on the specifics of the patient's case.

The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.    -   SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 gene testing: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for the SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 genes.
                    Childhood atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery. If doctors think there might be a brain tumor, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type of brain tumor. It is often difficult to completely remove AT/RT because of where the tumor is in the brain and because it may already have spread at the time of diagnosis.      The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This test is used to tell the difference between AT/RT and other brain tumors.","To assess the neurological function of a child suspected to have a CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, the following specific methods are employed:

1. **Physical Exam of the Throat**: A doctor can perform a physical examination to feel for swollen lymph nodes in the neck and visually inspect the throat for any abnormalities.

2. **Imaging Tests**:
   - **CT Scan (Computed Tomography)**: This procedure provides detailed pictures of the neck and throat from different angles, helping identify any masses or abnormalities.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: It offers detailed images of soft tissues in the neck, which can help in assessing the presence and extent of any tumors.
   - **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography)**: This scan helps find malignant tumor cells in the body and can determine the activity of the cells, as cancerous tissues typically consume more glucose than normal tissues.

3. **Endoscopy**: This procedure involves inserting a thin, lighted tube through the nose or mouth to visually inspect the throat and gather tissue samples for biopsy.

4. **Biopsy**: This is the definitive method for diagnosing cancer. A sample of suspect tissue can be removed and examined under a microscope for signs of malignancy.

These tests help rule out or confirm the presence of hypopharyngeal cancer while also considering other potential health issues that could cause similar symptoms.

Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:
                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.","Ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure significantly contributes to the risk of skin cancer by damaging the DNA in skin cells. This damage can lead to mutations that may result in the development of malignant cells. UV radiation is emitted by the sun, as well as from artificial sources like sunlamps and tanning beds. The risk factors for skin cancer are not the same for all types. For nonmelanoma skin cancer, additional risk factors include prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sunlight, having a fair complexion, which includes traits like fair skin that burns easily, and certain historical factors such as previous radiation treatment or a weakened immune system. For melanoma, risk factors also involve a history of blistering sunburns, the presence of multiple moles, and a family history of melanoma. 

In summary, while UV radiation is a crucial contributor, factors such as skin type, sun exposure history, genetic predispositions, and previous skin conditions also play significant roles in determining an individual's risk for developing skin cancer.",207,"How does ultraviolet radiation exposure contribute to the risk of skin cancer, and what other factors might play a role?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately discusses the relationship between ultraviolet (UV) radiation exposure and the risk of skin cancer, elaborating on the mechanisms of DNA damage and mutations.

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","Clinical trials play a critical role in the advancement of cancer treatments, including those for conditions like Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors (GISTs).

                    Primary myelofibrosis is a disease in which abnormal blood cells and fibers build up inside the bone marrow.
                    The bone marrow is made of tissues that make blood cells (red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets) and a web of fibers that support the blood-forming tissues. In primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis), large numbers of blood stem cells become blood cells that do not mature properly (blasts). The web of fibers inside the bone marrow also becomes very thick (like scar tissue) and slows the blood-forming tissues ability to make blood cells. This causes the blood-forming tissues to make fewer and fewer blood cells. In order to make up for the low number of blood cells made in the bone marrow, the liver and spleen begin to make the blood cells.","When determining the prognosis for someone diagnosed with primary myelofibrosis, certain factors are considered, which include:

- The age of the patient.
- The number of abnormal red blood cells and white blood cells.
- The number of blasts in the blood.

                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors form from germ cells in parts of the body other than the brain.
                    A germ cell is a type of cell that forms as a fetus (unborn baby) develops. These cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries. Sometimes while the fetus is forming, germ cells travel to parts of the body where they should not be and grow into a germ cell tumor. The tumor may form before or after birth.   This summary is about germ cell tumors that form in parts of the body that are extracranial (outside the brain). Extracranial germ cell tumors usually form in the following areas of the body:          - Testicles.    - Ovaries.    -  Sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine).    - Retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).    -  Mediastinum (area between the lungs).               Extracranial germ cell tumors are most common in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age.   See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for information on intracranial (inside the brain) germ cell tumors.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign or malignant.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer).
                
                
                    There are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped into mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and malignant germ cell tumors:      Mature Teratomas     Mature teratomas are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. Mature teratomas are benign tumors and not likely to become cancer. They usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or in the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. The cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope. Some mature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Immature Teratomas     Immature teratomas also usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. Immature teratomas have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. Immature teratomas may be cancer. They often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. Some immature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Malignant Germ Cell Tumors     Malignant germ cell tumors are cancer. There are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors:            - Germinomas: Tumors that make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). There are three types of germinomas.                  -  Dysgerminomas form in the ovary in girls.       -  Seminomas form in the testicle in boys.       - Germinomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle.                - Nongerminomas: There are four types of nongerminomas.                  - Yolk sac tumors make a hormone called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Choriocarcinomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Embryonal carcinomas may make a hormone called -hCG and/or a hormone called AFP. They can form in the testicle or other parts of the body, but not in the ovary.       - Mixed germ cell tumors are made up of both malignant germ cell tumor and teratoma. They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped as gonadal or extragonadal.
                    Malignant extracranial germ cell tumors are gonadal or extragonadal.     Gonadal Germ Cell Tumors    Gonadal germ cell tumors form in the testicles in boys or ovaries in girls.          Testicular Germ Cell Tumors        Testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two main types, seminoma and nonseminoma.               - Seminomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).      - Nonseminomas are usually large and cause signs or symptoms. They tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas.              Testicular germ cell tumors usually occur before the age of 4 years or in adolescents and young adults. Testicular germ cell tumors in adolescents and young adults are different from those that form in early childhood.     Boys older than 14 years with testicular germ cell tumors are treated in pediatric cancer centers, but the treatment is much like the treatment used in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Testicular Cancer Treatment for more information.)             Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors        Ovarian germ cell tumors are more common in adolescent girls and young women. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign teratomas. Sometimes immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors (cancer) occur. (See the PDQ summary on Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information.)          Extragonadal Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors    Extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form in areas other than the brain, testicles, or ovaries.    Most extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form along the midline of the body. This includes the following:             - Sacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower spine that forms part of the pelvis).     -  Coccyx (the small bone at the bottom of the spine, also called the tailbone).     -  Mediastinum (the area between the lungs).     -  Back of the abdomen.     -  Neck.           In younger children, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. Most of these tumors are teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx.    In older children, adolescents, and young adults, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum.","Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are typically diagnosed through a combination of imaging studies and blood tests. The diagnostic process may involve the following:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: A comprehensive examination to check for any unusual signs, including lumps.

2. **Serum Tumor Marker Test**: Blood tests to measure specific substances released by tumor cells, known as tumor markers. For childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, the relevant markers are:
   - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)
   - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG)

3. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: Evaluating blood samples for unusual levels of substances that may indicate disease.

4. **Imaging Studies**: Various imaging techniques may be utilized to visualize the tumors. Procedures include:
   - **Chest X-Ray**: For viewing the chest's internal organs and structures.
   - **CT Scan (CAT Scan)**: Offers detailed cross-sectional images of the body.
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Provides detailed images of internal organs using magnetic fields.
   - **Ultrasound Exam**: Uses sound waves to create images of internal organs.

5. **Biopsy**: In some cases, removal of tissue samples for microscopic examination may be performed to confirm the presence of cancer.

                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with pituitary tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    Many pituitary tumors can be removed by surgery using one of the following operations:            -  Transsphenoidal surgery: A type of surgery in which the instruments are inserted into part of the brain by going through an incision (cut) made under the upper lip or at the bottom of the nose between the nostrils and then through the sphenoid bone (a butterfly-shaped bone at the base of the skull) to reach the pituitary gland. The pituitary gland lies just above the sphenoid bone.     -  Endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery: A type of surgery in which an endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) made at the back of the inside of the nose and then through the sphenoid bone to reach the pituitary gland. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool for removing tumor tissue.     -  Craniotomy: Surgery to remove the tumor through an opening made in the skull.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Stereotactic radiosurgery: A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.                -   Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pituitary tumors.       Drug therapy     Drugs may be given to stop a functioning pituitary tumor from making too many hormones.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy may be used as palliative treatment for pituitary carcinomas, to relieve symptoms and improve the patient's quality of life. Chemotherapy uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

3. **Craniotomy**: This is a more invasive procedure where an opening is made in the skull to directly access and remove the tumor. This method is generally reserved for complex cases or when the tumor is not accessible by transsphenoidal techniques.

The main differences between these methods are the routes taken to access the pituitary gland and the tools used. Transsphenoidal and endoscopic surgeries are less invasive and involve fewer complications compared to craniotomy, which is more invasive and requires a longer recovery time.",199,Can you explain the different surgical techniques used for removing pituitary tumors and how they differ from one another?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the surgical techniques for removing pituitary tumors, detailing transsphenoidal surgery, endoscopic transsphenoidal surgery, and craniotomy.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with hypopharyngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of hypopharyngeal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:            - Laryngopharyngectomy: Surgery to remove the larynx (voice box) and part of the pharynx (throat).     - Partial laryngopharyngectomy: Surgery to remove part of the larynx and part of the pharynx. A partial laryngopharyngectomy prevents loss of the voice.      -  Neck dissection: Surgery to remove lymph nodes and other tissues in the neck.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat hypopharyngeal cancer.    Radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment. External radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works. A blood test to check the thyroid hormone level in the body may be done before and after therapy to make sure the thyroid gland is working properly.        Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    See Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer for more information. (Hypopharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    One type of standard treatment is used:
                    Surgery    One of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter:            -  Nephroureterectomy: Surgery to remove the entire kidney, the ureter, and the bladder cuff (tissue that connects the ureter to the bladder).     -  Segmental resection of the ureter: A surgical procedure to remove the part of the ureter that contains cancer and some of the healthy tissue around it. The ends of the ureter are then reattached. This treatment is used when the cancer is superficial and in the lower third of the ureter only, near the bladder.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.     Fulguration     Fulguration is a surgical procedure that destroys tissue using an electric current. A tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn away the tumor with electricity.       Segmental resection of the renal pelvis    This is a surgical procedure to remove localized cancer from the renal pelvis without removing the entire kidney. Segmental resection may be done to save kidney function when the other kidney is damaged or has already been removed.        Laser surgery    A laser beam (narrow beam of intense light) is used as a knife to remove the cancer. A laser beam can also be used to kill the cancer cells. This procedure may also be called or laser fulguration.       Regional chemotherapy and regional biologic therapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer; substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. Regional treatment means the anticancer drugs or biologic substances are placed directly into an organ or a body cavity such as the abdomen, so the drugs will affect cancer cells in that area. Clinical trials are studying chemotherapy or biologic therapy using drugs placed directly into the renal pelvis or the ureter.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

**Fulguration** is a surgical technique that destroys tissue using an electric current. This procedure involves a tool with a small wire loop that burns away the tumor or removes cancerous tissue by delivering electrical energy. 

**Laser surgery**, on the other hand, uses a focused beam of intense light to act like a knife to remove cancerous tissue. It can also be used to kill cancer cells in the affected area. This type of procedure is sometimes referred to as laser fulguration.

Both fulguration and laser surgery offer several advantages over traditional surgical methods, such as nephroureterectomy or segmental resection:

1. **Minimally Invasive**: These techniques are less invasive than traditional surgeries, which can lead to shorter recovery times and less postoperative pain for the patient.

2. **Precision**: Laser surgery and fulguration provide precise targeting of cancerous tissues, preserving more of the surrounding healthy tissues, which can help maintain kidney function.

3. **Lower Risk of Complications**: Because these procedures entail less cutting and trauma to the body, they often have lower risks associated with complications such as infection or bleeding compared to more extensive surgeries.

4. **Outpatient Procedures**: In many cases, these surgeries can be performed on an outpatient basis, allowing patients to return home the same day.

As such, fulguration and laser surgery represent promising options for targeted therapy approaches in the management of transitional cell cancer, particularly when preserving kidney function is a significant concern.",456,"Can you explain how fulguration and laser surgery are utilized in the treatment of transitional cell cancer, and what advantages they offer over traditional surgical methods?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of fulguration and laser surgery as treatment methods for transitional cell cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
                    Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric hematologist.    -  Pediatric radiologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.
                
                
                    Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. A type of surgery called wide local excision is often done. A wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it, including the lymph nodes. A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:            - Where in the body the tumor started.      - The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.     - The effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.     - How the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first.           In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.     Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site. Surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy. Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Radiation therapy may also be given. Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.        -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       - Volumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3-D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.       -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina, vulva, uterus, bladder, prostate, head, or neck. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy.           The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.     External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).    Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose, and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.    See Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma for more information.
                            
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

					                    Previously Untreated Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
					                    The treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. See the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.      Rhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck       - For tumors of the brain: Treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some tissues around the eye may be needed.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull but not in or near the eye: Treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.    - For tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including stereotactic body radiation therapy.    - For tumors of the larynx (voice box): Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs       -  Chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor was not completely removed, a second surgery to remove the tumor may be done. Radiation therapy may also be given.    - For tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. The tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.    -  Lymph node dissection (one or more lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer).                - For tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.      - For tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the groin area are removed.                    Rhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis       - For tumors in the chest or abdomen (including the chest wall or abdominal wall): Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given to shrink the tumor before surgery.    - For tumors of the pelvis: Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - For tumors of the diaphragm: A biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. Surgery may be done later to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - For tumors of the gallbladder or bile ducts: A biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.    - For tumors of the muscles or tissues around the anus or between the vulva and the anus or the scrotum and the anus: Surgery is done to remove as much of the tumor as possible and some nearby lymph nodes, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the kidney       - For tumors of the kidney: Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be given.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate       - For tumors that are only at the top of the bladder: Surgery (wide local excision) is done.    - For tumors of the prostate or bladder (other than the top of the bladder):                -  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given first to shrink the tumor. If cancer cells remain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery. Surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or pelvic exenteration without removal of the rectum. (This may include removal of the lower colon and bladder. In girls, the cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes may be removed).      - Chemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor, but not the bladder or prostate, is done. Internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.                    Rhabdomyosarcoma of the area near the testicles       -  Surgery to remove the testicle and spermatic cord. The lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen may be checked for cancer, especially if the lymph nodes are large or the child is 10 years or older.     -  Radiation therapy may be given if the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery.            Rhabdomyosarcoma of the vulva, vagina, uterus, cervix, or ovary       - For tumors of the vulva and vagina: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. Internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - For tumors of the uterus: Treatment may include chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery may be needed to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - For tumors of the cervix: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.    - For tumors of the ovary: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.          Metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma     Treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the tumor, is given to the site where the tumor first formed. If the cancer has spread to the brain, spinal cord, or lungs, radiation therapy may also be given to the sites where the cancer has spread.   The following treatment is being studied for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma:          - A clinical trial of immunotherapy (vaccine therapy).        Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials that are now accepting patients with previously untreated childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.

                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.    There are different types of immunotherapy:            -  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:                  -  CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.       -  PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD-1 inhibitors.                -  Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.              Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do. There are different types of targeted therapy:            -  mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive. Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  Antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better.

1. **Physical Problems**: This can encompass a range of issues affecting physical health and development.
   
2. **Changes in Mood, Feelings, Thinking, Learning, or Memory**: Children may experience emotional or cognitive alterations as a result of their treatment.

3. **Second Cancers**: There is a risk of developing new types of cancer after the initial treatment, which is a concern for some survivors.

Management or treatment of these late effects may involve:

- Regular follow-ups with healthcare providers to monitor and address any ongoing or emerging physical or psychological issues.
- Interventions such as physical therapy, counseling, or educational support to assist with changes in development or mood.
- Screening for secondary cancers, particularly if there is a concern based on treatment history or symptoms.

It is crucial for parents to have ongoing discussions with their child's healthcare team about potential late effects and available resources for management.",564,"What are the late effects of treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma that parents should be aware of, and how can these effects be managed or treated?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the late effects of treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma mentioned in the original answer, including physical problems, emotional changes, and the risk of secondary cancers.

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers helps kill more tumor cells.       Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by surgery     Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the cancer.

"Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen and liver. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells and platelets.       - The number and type of white blood cells.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.       - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views both the bone and bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.  The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. The cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms do not contain the Philadelphia chromosome that is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia.      -  Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of bone marrow. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the cells in the sample to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to tell the difference between myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia, and other conditions.","A complete blood count (CBC) with differential measures various components of the blood and is crucial in diagnosing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. Specifically, it checks:

- The number of red blood cells and platelets.
- The number and type of white blood cells.
- The amount of hemoglobin in the red blood cells.
- The proportion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.

This analysis is important because myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms involve abnormalities in blood cell production. In myelodysplastic neoplasms, there is ineffective blood cell maturation, leading to fewer healthy blood cells, while in myeloproliferative neoplasms, there is an overproduction of one or more types of blood cells. Therefore, the CBC with differential helps to reveal these abnormalities, guiding further diagnostic processes and treatment decisions.",235,Can you explain what a complete blood count (CBC) with differential measures and why it is important in diagnosing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains what a complete blood count (CBC) with differential measures and its significance in diagnosing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery). The factors that affect prognosis (chance of recovery) are different before and after treatment.    Before treatment, prognosis depends on:         - Whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or distant parts of the body.     - Where in the body the tumor started.    - Whether the tumor formed in the bone or in soft tissue.    - How large the tumor is at when the tumor is diagnosed.    - Whether the LDH level in the blood is higher than normal.    - Whether the tumor has certain gene changes.     - Whether the child is younger than 15 years.     - The patient's gender.     - Whether the child has had treatment for a different cancer before Ewing sarcoma.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        After treatment, prognosis is affected by:         - Whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery.    - Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy or radiation therapy.        If the cancer recurs after initial treatment, prognosis depends on:         - Whether the cancer came back more than two years after the initial treatment.    - Where in the body the tumor came back.    - The type of initial treatment given.","The timing of cancer recurrence in Ewing sarcoma patients significantly affects prognosis. If cancer recurs more than two years after the initial treatment, the prognosis tends to be more favorable compared to recurrences that happen sooner. This indicates that a longer interval without recurrence suggests a potentially better chance of recovery. Other factors, such as where the cancer comes back and the type of initial treatment given, also play a role in determining the prognosis after recurrence.",69,"How does the timing of cancer recurrence, specifically if it occurs more than two years after initial treatment, affect the prognosis for Ewing Sarcoma patients?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the specific aspect of prognosis related to the timing of cancer recurrence in Ewing sarcoma patients, specifically confirming that recurrence more than two years after initial treatment tends to indicate a better prognosis.

"Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor:                -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Blood levels of the tumor markers help determine if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Sometimes a CT scan and a PET scan are done at the same time. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy used depends on where the extragonadal germ cell tumor is found.                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or sample of tissue.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.","It is important to examine a patient's medical history and health habits in the process of diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors because this information can provide insight into risk factors, potential symptoms, and previous illnesses or treatments that may influence both the diagnosis and treatment options. A thorough medical history helps identify any significant past health issues and habits that might affect the prognosis and treatment strategies for the tumors, as well as assist in differentiating whether the observed signs and symptoms are related to the tumor or other health conditions. This understanding is essential for determining the most effective diagnostic tests and informing treatment plans tailored to the patient's specific circumstances.",19,Why is it important to examine a patient's medical history and health habits in the process of diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of examining a patient's medical history and health habits in the context of diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors.

                    There are different types of treatment for children with extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    Different types of treatments are available for children with extracranial germ cell tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with extracranial germ cell tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with extracranial germ cell tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Pediatric hematologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Child life professional.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Geneticist.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.     - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.     -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).         For example, late effects of surgery to remove tumors in the sacrum or coccyx include constipation, loss of bowel and bladder control, and scars.   Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    Surgery to completely remove the tumor is done whenever possible. If the tumor is very large, chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. A goal of surgery is to keep reproductive function. The following types of surgery may be used:            -  Resection: Surgery to remove tissue or part or all of an organ.     - Radical inguinal orchiectomy: Surgery to remove one or both testicles through an incision (cut) in the groin.     -  Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube on the same side.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. For childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, this includes physical exams, imaging tests, and tumor marker tests.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether it has come back. External radiation therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors that have come back.

                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   For childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) tests and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) tests are done to see if treatment is working. Continued high levels of AFP or -hCG may mean the cancer is still growing. For at least 3 years after surgery, follow-up will include regular physical exams, imaging tests, and tumor marker tests.

		                    There is no standard treatment for recurrent childhood malignant extracranial germ cell tumors. Treatment depends on the following:         - The type of treatment given when the cancer was diagnosed.    - How the tumor responded to the initial treatment.        Treatment is usually within a clinical trial and may include the following:         -  Surgery.    - Surgery followed by combination chemotherapy, for most malignant extracranial germ cell tumors including immature teratomas, malignant testicular germ cell tumors, and malignant ovarian germ cell tumors.     - Surgery for tumors that come back in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine), if surgery to remove the sacrum and coccyx was not done when the cancer was diagnosed. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery, to shrink the tumor. If any tumor remains after surgery, radiation therapy may also be given.    - Combination chemotherapy for stage I malignant testicular germ cell tumors and stage I ovarian dysgerminomas.    -  High-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant.    - Radiation therapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor in the brain for cancer that has spread to the brain.    - A clinical trial of combination chemotherapy alone compared with high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant.

General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","The surgical procedures available for removing tumors in childhood extracranial germ cell tumors vary based on the tumor's location and type. Here are the different procedures:

1. **Resection**: Surgery to remove tissue or a part or all of an organ is done whenever possible. This is the standard procedure when the tumor's location allows for it.

2. **Radical Inguinal Orchiectomy**: This procedure involves the surgical removal of one or both testicles through an incision in the groin, typically used for testicular germ cell tumors.

3. **Unilateral Salpingo-Oophorectomy**: Surgery to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube on the same side, commonly performed for ovarian germ cell tumors.

4. **Specific Procedures Based on Tumor Type and Location**:
   - For **Mature and Immature Teratomas**: When these occur outside the sacrum or coccyx, surgery may involve direct removal, followed by observation. For immature teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx, removal of these structures may be necessary.
   - For **Malignant Gonadal Germ Cell Tumors**: In boys younger than 15, surgery (radical inguinal orchiectomy) followed by observation is typical for early-stage tumors, while advanced stages may require surgery followed by combination chemotherapy. For older boys, surgery may also include lymph node removal.
   - For **Malignant Extragonadal Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors**: Surgery may involve the removal of tumors from various locations, including the sacrum or mediastinum, often accompanied by chemotherapy to shrink the tumors beforehand.

These surgical approaches demonstrate that the location (e.g., testicles, ovaries, sacrum, coccyx, mediastinum) and type of germ cell tumor (e.g., benign, malignant, mature, immature) greatly influence the surgical strategy employed for tumor removal in pediatric patients.",110,"What are the different surgical procedures available for removing tumors in childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, and how do they vary based on the tumor's location and type?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the different surgical procedures available for removing tumors in childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, detailing specific procedures and how they vary based on tumor location and type, which aligns closely with the original answer's content."

                    Childhood vascular tumors form from cells that make blood vessels or lymph vessels.
                    Vascular tumors can form from abnormal blood vessel or lymph vessel cells anywhere in the body. They may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). There are many types of vascular tumors. The most common type of childhood vascular tumor is hemangioma, which is a benign tumor that usually goes away on its own.   Because malignant vascular tumors are rare in children, there is not a lot of information about what treatment works best.

																			                    Infantile Hemangioma
																			                    Infantile hemangiomas are the most common type of benign vascular tumor in children. An infantile hemangioma may also be called a ""strawberry mark."" Immature cells that are meant to form blood vessels form a tumor instead. These tumors are not usually seen at birth but appear when the infant is 3 to 6 weeks old. Most hemangiomas get bigger for about 5 months, then stop growing and slowly fade away completely during the next several years. It is rare for them to come back.   Hemangiomas may be on the skin, in the tissue below the skin, and/or in an organ. They are usually on the head and neck but can be anywhere on or in the body. Hemangiomas may appear as a single lesion, one or more lesions spread over a larger area of the body, or multiple lesions in more than one part of the body. Lesions that are spread over a larger area of the body or multiple lesions are more likely to cause problems.    Risk Factors    Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.   Infantile hemangiomas are more common in the following:          - Girls.    - Whites.    - Premature babies.    -  Twins, triplets, or other multiple births.     - Babies of mothers who are older at time of the pregnancy or who have problems with the placenta during pregnancy.        Other risk factors for infantile hemangiomas include the following:         - Having certain syndromes.               -  PHACE syndrome: A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the body (usually the head or face). Other health problems involving the large blood vessels, heart, eyes, and/or brain may also occur.       -  LUMBAR/PELVIS/SACRAL syndrome: A syndrome in which the hemangioma spreads across a large area of the lower back. Other health problems that affect the urinary system, genitals, rectum, anus, brain, spinal cord, and nerve function may also occur.                 Having more than one hemangioma or an airway hemangioma increases the risk of having other health problems.         - Multiple hemangiomas: Having more than five hemangiomas on the skin is a sign that there may be hemangiomas in an organ, most commonly the liver. Heart, muscle, and thyroid gland problems can also occur.     - Airway hemangiomas: Hemangiomas in the airway usually occur along with a large, beard-shaped area of hemangioma on the face (from the ears, around the mouth, lower chin, and front of neck). It is important for airway hemangiomas to be treated before the child has trouble breathing.         Signs and Symptoms    Infantile hemangiomas may cause any of the following signs and symptoms. Check with your childs doctor if your child has any of the following:         - Skin lesions: An area of spidery veins or lightened or discolored skin may appear before the hemangioma does. Hemangiomas occur as firm, warm, bright red-blue lesions on the skin. Lesions that form ulcers are also painful. Later, as the hemangiomas go away, they begin fading in the center before flattening and losing color.    - Lesions below the skin: Lesions that grow under the skin in the fat may appear blue or purple. If the lesions are deep enough under the skin surface, they may not be seen.    - Lesions in an organ: There may be no signs that hemangiomas have formed on an organ.        Although most infantile hemangiomas are nothing to worry about, if your child develops any lumps or red or blue marks on the skin check with your child's doctor. He or she can recommend a specialist if needed.     Diagnostic Tests    A physical exam and history are usually all that are needed to diagnose infantile hemangiomas. If there is something about the tumor that looks unusual, a biopsy may be done. If the hemangioma is deeper inside the body with no change to the skin, or the lesions are spread across a large area of the body, an ultrasound or MRI may be done. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures.    If the hemangiomas are part of a syndrome, more tests may be done such as an echocardiogram, magnetic resonance angiogram, and eye exam.    Treatment    Most hemangiomas fade and shrink without treatment. If the hemangioma is large or causing other health problems, treatment may include the following:          -  Propranolol or other beta-blocker therapy.    -  Steroid therapy, before beta-blocker therapy is begun or when beta-blockers cannot be used.    - Pulsed dye laser surgery, for hemangiomas that have ulcers or have not gone away.     -  Surgery (excision) for hemangiomas that have ulcers, cause vision problems, or have not gone away.    -  Topical beta-blocker therapy for hemangiomas that are in one area of the skin.    -  Combined therapy, such as propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta-blocker therapy.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Congenital Hemangioma
																			                    Congenital hemangioma is a benign vascular tumor that begins forming before birth and is fully formed when the baby is born. They're usually on the skin but can be in another organ.   There are three types of congenital hemangiomas:         -  Rapidly Involuting Congenital Hemangioma: These tumors go away on their own 12 to 15 months after birth. They can form ulcers, bleed, and cause temporary heart and blood clotting problems. The skin may look a little different even after the hemangiomas go away.    -  Partial Involuting Congenital Hemangioma: These tumors do not go away completely.    -  Non-Involuting Congenital Hemangioma: These tumors never go away on their own.          Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose congenital hemangioma.    Treatment    Treatment of rapidly involuting congenital hemangioma and partial involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following:         -  Observation only.        Treatment of non-involuting congenital hemangioma may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor depending on where it is and whether it is causing symptoms.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Benign Vascular Tumors of the Liver
																			                    Benign vascular tumors of the liver may be focal (a single lesion in one area of the liver), multifocal (multiple lesions in one area of the liver), or diffuse (multiple lesions in more than one area of the liver).    The liver has many functions, including filtering blood and making proteins needed for blood clotting. Sometimes, blood that normally flows through the liver is blocked or slowed by the tumor. This sends blood directly to the heart without going through the liver and is called a liver shunt. This can cause heart failure and problems with blood clotting.    Focal Tumors    Focal tumors are usually rapidly involuting congenital hemangiomas or non-involuting congenital hemangiomas.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose focal benign vascular tumors.    Treatment    Treatment of focal tumors of the liver depends on whether symptoms occur and may include the following:         -  Observation.    -  Drugs to manage symptoms, including heart failure and blood clotting problems.    -  Embolization of the liver to manage symptoms, including heart failure.         Multifocal and Diffuse Tumors     Multifocal and diffuse tumors of the liver are usually infantile hemangiomas. Diffuse tumors of the liver can cause serious effects, including problems with the thyroid gland and heart. The liver can enlarge, press on other organs, and cause more symptoms.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose multifocal or diffuse benign vascular tumors.    Treatment    Treatment of multifocal and diffuse liver tumors may include the following:         - Observation for multifocal tumors of the liver that do not cause symptoms.    -  Beta-blocker therapy (propranolol).    -  Chemotherapy.    -  Steroid therapy.    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant, when the tumors do not respond to drug therapy. This is only done when the tumors have spread widely in the liver and more than one organ has failed.        If a vascular tumor of the liver does not respond to standard treatments, a biopsy may be done to see if the tumor has become malignant.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Spindle Cell Hemangioma
																			                    Spindle cell hemangiomas contain cells called spindle cells. Under a microscope, spindle cells look long and slender.    Risk Factors    Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Spindle cell hemangiomas are likely to occur in children with the following syndromes:         -  Maffucci syndrome, which affects cartilage and skin.    -  Klippel-Trenaunay syndrome, which affects blood vessels, soft tissues, and bones.         Signs    Spindle cell hemangiomas appear on or under the skin. They are painful red-brown or bluish lesions that usually appear on the arms or legs. They can begin as one lesion and develop into more lesions over years.     Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose spindle cell hemangioma.    Treatment    There is no standard treatment for spindle cell hemangiomas. Treatment may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor.        Spindle cell hemangiomas may come back after surgery.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Epithelioid Hemangioma
																			                    Epithelioid hemangiomas usually form on or in the skin, especially the head, but can occur in other areas, such as bone.    Signs and Symptoms    Epithelioid hemangiomas are sometimes caused by injury. On the skin, they may appear as firm pink to red bumps and may be itchy. Epithelioid hemangioma of the bone may cause swelling, pain, and weakened bone in the affected area.     Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioma.    Treatment    There is no standard treatment for epithelioid hemangiomas. Treatment may include the following:         -  Surgery (curettage or resection).    -  Sclerotherapy.    -  Radiation therapy in rare cases.        Epithelioid hemangiomas often come back after treatment.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Pyogenic Granuloma
																			                    Pyogenic granuloma is also called lobular capillary hemangioma. It is most common in older children and young adults but may occur at any age.    The lesions are sometimes caused by injury or from the use of certain medicines, including birth control pills and retinoids. They may also form for no known reason inside capillaries (the smallest blood vessels) or other places on the body. Usually there is only one lesion, but sometimes multiple lesions occur in the same area or the lesions may spread to other areas of the body.    Signs    Pyogenic granulomas are raised, bright red lesions that may be small or large and smooth or bumpy. They grow quickly over weeks to months and may bleed a lot.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose pyogenic granuloma.    Treatment    Some pyogenic granulomas go away without treatment. Other pyogenic granulomas need treatment that may include the following:         -  Surgery (excision or curettage) to remove the lesion.    -  Laser photocoagulation.        Pyogenic granulomas often come back after treatment.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Angiofibroma
																			                    Angiofibromas are rare. They are benign skin lesions that usually occur with a condition called tuberous sclerosis (an inherited disorder that causes skin lesions, seizures, and mental disabilities).     Signs    Angiofibromas appear as red bumps on the face.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiofibroma.    Treatment    Treatment of angiofibromas may include the following:         -  Surgery (excision) to remove the tumor.    -  Laser therapy.    -  Targeted therapy (sirolimus).
																			                
																			                
																			                    Juvenile Nasopharyngeal Angiofibroma
																			                    Juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas are benign tumors but they can invade nearby tissue. They begin in the nasal cavity and may spread to the nasopharynx, the paranasal sinuses, the bone around the eyes, and sometimes to the brain.     Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma.    Treatment    Treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibromas may include the following:         -  Surgery (excision) to remove the tumor.    -  Radiation therapy.    -  Chemotherapy.    -  Immunotherapy (interferon).    -  Targeted therapy (sirolimus).

																			                    Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are blood vessel tumors that occur in infants or during early childhood. These tumors can cause Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon, a condition in which the blood is not able to clot and serious bleeding may occur. In Kasabach-Merritt phenomenon the tumor traps and destroys platelets (blood-clotting cells). Then there aren't enough platelets in the blood when needed to stop bleeding. This type of vascular tumor is not related to Kaposi sarcoma.    Signs and Symptoms    Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas usually occur on the skin of the arms and legs, but may also form in deeper tissues, such as muscle or bone. Signs and symptoms may include the following:         - Firm, painful areas of skin that look bruised.    - Purple or brownish-red areas of skin.    - Easy bruising.    -  Bleeding more than the usual amount from mucous membranes, wounds, and other tissues.    -  Anemia (weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale).         Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.   If a physical exam and MRI clearly show the tumor is a kaposiform hemangioendothelioma or a tufted angioma, a biopsy may not be needed. A biopsy is not always done because serious bleeding can occur.    Treatment    Treatment of kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas depends on the child's symptoms. Infection, delay in treatment, and surgery can cause bleeding that is life-threatening. Kaposiform hemangioendotheliomas and tufted angiomas are best treated by a vascular anomaly specialist.   Treatment and supportive care to manage bleeding may include the following:         -  Steroid therapy which may be followed by chemotherapy.    -  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as aspirin.    -  Immunotherapy (interferon).    -  Antifibrinolytic therapy to improve blood clotting.    -  Chemotherapy with one or more anticancer drugs.    -  Beta-blocker therapy (propranolol).    -  Surgery (excision) to remove the tumor, with or without embolization.    -  Targeted therapy (sirolimus).    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy (sirolimus) and steroid therapy.        Even with treatment, these tumors do not fully go away and can come back. Long-term effects include chronic pain, heart failure, bone problems, and lymphedema (the build up of lymph fluid in tissues).

																			                    Retiform Hemangioendothelioma
																			                    Retiform hemangioendotheliomas are slow growing, flat tumors that occur in young adults and sometimes children. These tumors usually occur on or under the skin of the arms, legs, and trunk. These tumors often come back after treatment, but they usually do not spread to other parts of the body.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose retiform hemangioendothelioma.    Treatment    Treatment of retiform hemangioendotheliomas may include the following:         -  Surgery (excision) to remove the tumor. Follow up will include monitoring to see if the tumor comes back.    -  Radiation therapy and chemotherapy when surgery cannot be done or when the tumor has come back.

																			                    Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas are also called Dabska tumors. These tumors form in or under the skin anywhere on the body. The tumors contain channels that look like lymph vessels. Lymph nodes are sometimes affected.    Signs    Papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may appear as firm, raised, purplish bumps, which may be small or large. These tumors grow slowly over time.    Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose papillary intralymphatic angioendothelioma.    Treatment    Treatment of papillary intralymphatic angioendotheliomas may include the following:         -  Surgery (excision) to remove the tumor.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Composite Hemangioendothelioma
																			                    Composite hemangioendotheliomas have features of both benign and malignant vascular tumors. These tumors usually occur on or under the skin on the arms or legs. They may also occur on the head, neck, or chest. Composite hemangioendotheliomas are not likely to metastasize (spread) but they may come back in the same place. When the tumors metastasize, they usually spread to nearby lymph nodes.     Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose composite hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread.     Treatment     Treatment of composite hemangioendotheliomas may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor.    -  Radiation therapy and chemotherapy for tumors that have spread.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Kaposi Sarcoma
																			                    Kaposi sarcoma is a cancer that causes lesions to grow in the skin; the mucous membranes lining the mouth, nose, and throat; lymph nodes; or other organs. It is caused by the Kaposi sarcoma herpes virus (KSHV). In the United States, it usually occurs in people who have a weak immune system caused by AIDS or by drugs used in organ transplants. It is very rare in children and can be caused by HIV infection and rare immune system disorders.    Signs     Signs in children may include the following:         - Lesions in the skin, mouth, or throat. Skin lesions are red, purple, or brown and change from flat, to raised, to scaly areas called plaques, to nodules.    - Swollen lymph nodes.         Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma.    Treatment    Treatment of Kaposi sarcoma may include the following:         -  Chemotherapy.

																			                    Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas can occur in children, but are most common in adults between 30 and 50 years of age. They usually occur in the liver, lung, or in bone. They may be either fast growing or slow growing. In about a third of cases, the tumor spreads to other parts of the body very quickly.     Signs and Symptoms     Signs and symptoms depend on where the tumor is:          - On the skin, the tumors can be raised and rounded or flat, red-brown patches that feel warm.     - In the lung, there may be no early symptoms. Signs and symptoms that occur may include:               -  Chest pain.       - Spitting up blood.      -  Anemia (weakness, feeling tired, or looking pale).      - Trouble breathing (from scarred lung tissue).              - In bone, the tumors can cause breaks.         Diagnostic Tests    Epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas in the liver are found with CT scans and MRI scans. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures used to diagnose epithelioid hemangioendothelioma and find out whether the tumor has spread. X-rays may also be done.    Treatment    Treatment of slow-growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas includes the following:         -  Observation.        Treatment of fast-growing epithelioid hemangioendotheliomas may include the following:         -  Surgery to remove the tumor when possible.    -  Immunotherapy (interferon) and targeted therapy (thalidomide, sorafenib, pazopanib, sirolimus) for tumors that are likely to spread.    -  Chemotherapy.    - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant when the tumor is in the liver.
																			                
																			                
																			                    Angiosarcoma of the Soft Tissue
																			                    Angiosarcomas are fast-growing tumors that form in blood vessels or lymph vessels in any part of the body, usually in soft tissue. Most angiosarcomas are in or near the skin. Those in deeper soft tissue can form in the liver, spleen, and lung.   These tumors are very rare in children. Children sometimes have more than one tumor in the skin and/or liver.    Risk Factors    Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get the disease; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get the disease. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk. Risk factors for angiosarcomas include the following:         - Being exposed to radiation.    -  Chronic (long-term) lymphedema, a condition in which extra lymph fluid builds up in tissues and causes swelling.     - Having a benign vascular tumor. A benign tumor, such as a hemangioma, may become an angiosarcoma but this rare.         Signs    Signs of angiosarcoma depend on where the tumor is and may include the following:         - Red patches on the skin that bleed easily.    - Purple tumors.         Diagnostic Tests    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to diagnose angiosarcoma and find out whether the tumor has spread.     Treatment    Treatment of angiosarcoma may include the following:         -  Surgery to completely remove the tumor.    - A combination of surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation therapy for angiosarcomas that have spread.    -  Targeted therapy (bevacizumab) and chemotherapy for angiosarcomas that began as infantile hemangiomas.    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy, radiation therapy, and surgery with or without chemotherapy.","To diagnose congenital hemangiomas, the following tests are commonly used:

1. **Physical Examination**: A healthcare provider assesses the lesion's characteristics and reviews the patient's medical history.
2. **Biopsy**: If necessary, a sample of the hemangioma tissue may be taken for microscopic examination to confirm the diagnosis.
3. **Ultrasound or MRI**: These imaging tests may be used to evaluate deeper hemangiomas that are not visible on the surface.

In contrast, the diagnosis of infantile hemangiomas typically relies on:

1. **Physical Examination**: Similar to congenital hemangiomas, the provider examines the skin lesions and takes a history.
2. **Ultrasound or MRI**: These imaging studies can help assess the extent of the hemangioma, especially if it is deep or causes symptoms.
3. **Biopsy**: Generally, biopsies are less common for infantile hemangiomas, since their typical clinical course and appearance often allow for diagnosis without invasive testing.

The primary difference in testing for congenital hemangiomas versus infantile hemangiomas lies in the timing and context of their identification. Congenital hemangiomas are identified at birth as they are fully formed, while infantile hemangiomas develop later during infancy. Consequently, treatment approaches may vary based on the specific type and behavior of the hemangiomas.",565,"What diagnostic tests are commonly used to identify congenital hemangiomas, and how do they differ from testing for infantile hemangiomas?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the diagnostic tests used for congenital hemangiomas and contrasts them with those for infantile hemangiomas, mirroring the detailed content and context found in the original answer.

"Having hepatitis or cirrhosis can increase the risk of developing liver cancer. Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor. Risk factors for liver cancer include:         - Having hepatitis B or hepatitis C; having both hepatitis B and hepatitis C increases the risk even more.    - Having cirrhosis, which can be caused by:                -  hepatitis (especially hepatitis C); or      - drinking large amounts of alcohol for many years or being an alcoholic.             - Eating foods tainted with aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly).","Individuals considered at risk for liver cancer should take the following steps in discussions with their healthcare providers regarding preventive measures or screenings:

1. **Identify Risk Factors**: Discuss any personal or familial history of conditions that can increase the risk of liver cancer, such as hepatitis B, hepatitis C, or cirrhosis.

2. **Vaccination**: Inquire about the hepatitis B vaccine, which can help prevent the virus known to increase liver cancer risk.

3. **Screening Options**: Ask about appropriate screening tests for liver cancer, especially if they have risk factors like chronic hepatitis or cirrhosis.

4. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Discuss lifestyle changes that could reduce risk, such as avoiding excessive alcohol consumption and maintaining a healthy weight.

5. **Follow-Up and Monitoring**: Regularly monitor liver health through blood tests and imaging studies, as recommended by the healthcare provider, particularly if they have existing liver diseases.

6. **Clinical Trials**: Explore participation in clinical trials studying new preventive strategies or screening methods that might be relevant to their situation. 

Discussing these steps with healthcare providers can aid in the early detection and prevention of liver cancer.",706,What steps should individuals considered at risk for liver cancer take in discussions with their healthcare providers regarding preventive measures or screenings?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the concerns of individuals at risk for liver cancer, aligning well with the original answer's emphasis on discussing risk factors and preventative measures with healthcare providers.

                    - Screening tests have risks.    - The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:         -  Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     - False-negative test results can occur.     - False-positive test results can occur.
                
                
                    Screening tests have risks.
                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
                
                
                    The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:
                    Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     When a screening test result leads to the diagnosis and treatment of a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening, it is called overdiagnosis. For example, when a urine test result shows a higher than normal amount of homovanillic acid (HMA) or vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA), tests and treatments for neuroblastoma are likely to be done, but may not be needed. At this time, it is not possible to know which neuroblastomas found by a screening test will cause symptoms and which neuroblastomas will not. Diagnostic tests (such as biopsies) and cancer treatments (such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) can have serious risks, including physical and emotional problems.       False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though neuroblastoma is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests and procedures, which also have risks.","The potential risks associated with screening tests for neuroblastoma include:

1. Overdiagnosis: Neuroblastoma may be diagnosed and treated based on screening results even when it may never cause symptoms or become life-threatening. For example, elevated levels of homovanillic acid (HMA) or vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA) found in urine tests can lead to unnecessary treatments.

2. False-negative test results: A screening test may appear normal even when neuroblastoma is present, leading to a delay in seeking medical care despite symptoms.

3. False-positive test results: A screening test may indicate cancer when there isn't any, causing unnecessary anxiety and prompting further tests and procedures, which come with their own risks.",179,What are the potential risks associated with screening tests for neuroblastoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding the potential risks associated with screening tests for neuroblastoma.

                    Retinoblastoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the retina.
                    The retina is the nerve tissue that lines the inside of the back of the eye. The retina senses light and sends images to the brain by way of the optic nerve.      Although retinoblastoma may occur at any age, it occurs most often in children younger than 2 years. The cancer may be in one eye (unilateral) or in both eyes (bilateral). Retinoblastoma rarely spreads from the eye to nearby tissue or other parts of the body.    Cavitary retinoblastoma is a rare type of retinoblastoma in which cavities (hollow spaces) form within the tumor.
                
                
                    Treatment for both forms of retinoblastoma should include genetic counseling.
                    Parents should receive genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about the risk of genetic diseases) to discuss genetic testing to check for a mutation (change) in the RB1 gene. Genetic counseling also includes a discussion of the risk of retinoblastoma for the child and the child's brothers or sisters.","The prognosis for a child with heritable retinoblastoma is concerning due to the increased risk of developing trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers. Children with this form of retinoblastoma are particularly at risk for developing a pineal tumor in the brain, which is classified as trilateral retinoblastoma when it occurs concurrently with retinoblastoma. This brain tumor is typically diagnosed between 20 and 36 months of age. Additionally, heritable retinoblastoma elevates the child's risk for other cancers such as lung cancer, bladder cancer, or melanoma later in life. Therefore, regular follow-up exams and screenings are essential for monitoring these associated risks.",645,"What does the prognosis for a child with heritable retinoblastoma look like, particularly regarding the associated risks of developing trilateral retinoblastoma or other types of cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the prognosis for a child with heritable retinoblastoma and elaborates on the associated risks, including the increased likelihood of developing trilateral retinoblastoma and other cancers.

                    - Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.     - Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.     - Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting colorectal cancer.
                
                
                    Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.
                    The colon and rectum are parts of the body's digestive system. The digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6-8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).      Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that begins in either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer.

                    The number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are decreasing a little bit each year. But in adults younger than 50 years, there has been a small increase in the number of new cases each year since 1998. Colorectal cancer is found more often in men than in women.","The colon and rectum play crucial roles in the digestive system. The digestive system is responsible for removing and processing nutrients from food—such as vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water—and for helping to pass waste material out of the body. 

The colon, also known as the large bowel, is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Its primary function includes absorbing water, electrolytes, and remaining nutrients from digested food, as well as forming stool. Following the colon, the rectum and anal canal, which together measure about 6 to 8 inches, form the last part of the large intestine. The rectum stores stool until it is expelled through the anus.

Colorectal cancer is a disease characterized by the presence of malignant cells that form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.

"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood astrocytomas. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health. This includes checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue.
                    Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery. If doctors think there may be an astrocytoma, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue. Sometimes, the needle is guided by a computer. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. Because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors, you may want to have your child's tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors.     The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. An MIB-1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This may show how fast a tumor is growing.        Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove. If removing the tumor may cause severe physical, emotional, or learning problems, a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy.   Children who have NF1 may form a low-grade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy. If the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur, surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed.","Gadolinium plays a crucial role in enhancing MRI scans for diagnosing childhood astrocytomas. During an MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) scan, gadolinium is injected into a vein and collects around the cancer cells, making them appear brighter in the images produced. This increased contrast allows for better visualization of the tumor’s characteristics, helping to differentiate it from surrounding healthy tissue. The enhanced imaging facilitated by gadolinium is particularly important in assessing the extent of the tumor, whether any cancer remains after surgery, and in planning further treatment options based on the tumor's response. This method of imaging contributes significantly to the accurate diagnosis and subsequent management of childhood astrocytomas.",281,Can you explain the significance of using gadolinium in MRI scans for diagnosing childhood astrocytomas and how it enhances the imaging of tumor cells?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer focuses specifically on the role of gadolinium in MRI scans for diagnosing childhood astrocytomas, which aligns directly with the detailed explanation in the original answer.

"Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer.    Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:            -  Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.      -  Being exposed to secondhand smoke.     - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following:                  -  Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.       -  Radon in the home or workplace.       -  Imaging tests such as CT scans.       - Atomic bomb radiation.                 -  Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace.     -  Living where there is air pollution.     -  Having a family history of lung cancer.     -  Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).     -  Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.     When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.","Exposure to secondhand smoke and occupational hazards like asbestos significantly contribute to the risk of lung cancer through the following mechanisms:

1. **Secondhand Smoke**: Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is a recognized risk factor for lung cancer. Individuals exposed to secondhand smoke inhale the same cancer-causing agents as smokers, albeit in reduced amounts. This involuntary or passive smoking increases their risk of developing lung cancer.

2. **Occupational Hazards like Asbestos**: Exposure to asbestos in the workplace is a well-documented risk factor for lung cancer. Studies indicate that individuals exposed to asbestos may have a higher risk of developing lung cancer, especially when combined with other risk factors such as smoking. As the level of exposure to asbestos increases, so does the risk of lung cancer.

Both of these factors highlight how environmental and occupational exposures can have serious implications for lung cancer risk.",37,How do exposure to secondhand smoke and occupational hazards like asbestos contribute to the risk of lung cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question concerning the contributions of secondhand smoke and occupational hazards like asbestos to lung cancer risk.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - The type of small intestine cancer.     - Whether the cancer is in the inner lining of the small intestine only or has spread into or beyond the wall of the small intestine.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or peritoneum (tissue that lines the wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen).    -  Whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery.    - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred.","The distinction between newly diagnosed small intestine cancer and recurrent cancer significantly impacts a patient’s treatment options and prognosis. 

For **newly diagnosed small intestine cancer**, treatment typically includes surgery as the primary option, especially if the cancer can be completely removed. If surgery is not feasible, radiation therapy and chemotherapy might be utilized to manage the disease or improve quality of life. Additionally, patients may have the opportunity to participate in clinical trials exploring new treatments.

In contrast, for **recurrent small intestine cancer**, the treatment approach differs. The options may include clinical trials focusing on new anticancer drugs or biologic therapy. For locally recurrent cancer, surgery might again be an option, along with palliative radiation therapy or chemotherapy to alleviate symptoms. The prognosis for recurrent cancer is generally poorer than that for newly diagnosed cancer, as recurrence typically indicates that the disease has not only returned but may have spread, thus complicating treatment outcomes. 

Overall, the ability to surgically intervene and the stage of the disease at the time of diagnosis crucially shape both the treatment strategies and the expected prognosis for patients.",267,How does the distinction between newly diagnosed small intestine cancer and recurrent cancer alter a patient's treatment options and prognosis?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses how the distinction between newly diagnosed and recurrent small intestine cancer impacts treatment options and prognosis, which closely aligns with the factors mentioned in the original answer.

                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Two types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery may include neck dissection. There are different types of neck dissection, based on the amount of tissue that is removed.             - Radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove tissues in one or both sides of the neck between the jawbone and the collarbone, including the following:                  - All lymph nodes.       - The jugular vein.       - Muscles and nerves that are used for face, neck, and shoulder movement, speech, and swallowing.            The patient may need physical therapy of the throat, neck, shoulder, and/or arm after radical neck dissection. Radical neck dissection may be used when cancer has spread widely in the neck.      - Modified radical neck dissection: Surgery to remove all the lymph nodes in one or both sides of the neck without removing the neck muscles. The nerves and/or the jugular vein may be removed.      - Partial neck dissection: Surgery to remove some of the lymph nodes in the neck. This is also called selective neck dissection.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of radiation therapy is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and damage to the skin.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.    Radiation therapy to the neck may change the way the thyroid gland works. Blood tests may be done to check the thyroid hormone level in the body before treatment and at regular checkups after treatment.

                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).        Hyperfractionated radiation therapy     Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is a type of external radiation treatment in which a smaller than usual total daily dose of radiation is divided into two doses and the treatments are given twice a day. Hyperfractionated radiation therapy is given over the same period of time (days or weeks) as standard radiation therapy.

                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.
                    The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes, which have many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can produce milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts.     Each breast also contains blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels lead to organs called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about breast cancer:         -  Breast Cancer Prevention     -  Breast Cancer Treatment     -  Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers
                
                
                    Breast cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in American women.
                    Women in the United States get breast cancer more than any other type of cancer except for skin cancer. Breast cancer is second only to lung cancer as a cause of cancer death in women.    Breast cancer occurs more often in white women than in black women. However, black women are more likely than white women to die from the disease.   Breast cancer occurs in men also, but the number of cases is small.","The role of lymph vessels and lymph nodes in relation to breast cancer is crucial, as they are integral components of the body's lymphatic system, which helps in the spread and staging of cancer. 

When breast cancer cells break away from the primary tumor, they can enter the lymphatic system. The lymph vessels carry these cancer cells to the nearest lymph nodes, which act as filters for harmful substances. In breast cancer, the sentinel lymph node—which is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor—often indicates whether cancer has spread. During staging, a sentinel lymph node biopsy is performed to assess if cancer cells are present in these nodes. If cancer is found in the sentinel lymph node, it may suggest that the cancer has begun to metastasize to other parts of the body.

The information gathered from the lymph nodes is essential for determining the stage of breast cancer, which is a key factor in planning treatment. Therefore, lymph vessels and lymph nodes play a significant role in the dissemination of breast cancer cells and help guide the management of the disease.",548,Can you explain the role of lymph vessels and lymph nodes in relation to breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of the role of lymph vessels and lymph nodes in relation to breast cancer, directly addressing the question and reflecting relevant information about the lymphatic system's involvement in cancer spread, staging, and management.

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). Treatment for AT/RT is usually within a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with central nervous system cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:          -  Pediatrician.    - Pediatric neurosurgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Geneticist or genetic counselor.
                
                
                    Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Four types of treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is used to diagnose and treat CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. See the General Information section of this summary.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, most patients will be given chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.             - When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. Anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.     - When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). High doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor.              Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread. External radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord.     Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children.        High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.

                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.    Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

							                    Because atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is fast-growing, a combination of treatments is usually given. After surgery to remove the tumor, treatments for AT/RT may include combinations of the following:         - Chemotherapy.    -  Radiation therapy.    -  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant.         Clinical trials of new treatments should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.","Clinical trials significantly contribute to the treatment options available for childhood Central Nervous System (CNS) atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) by exploring new treatments and improving existing therapies. Research through clinical trials is critical because there is no standard treatment for AT/RT, and combinations of surgery, chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant are commonly used. These trials test the safety and effectiveness of new therapies, including targeted therapies, which may cause less harm to normal cells compared to traditional treatments. Participation in clinical trials can provide patients access to the latest treatments and contribute to the advancement of cancer research, potentially benefiting future patients.

When families are considering participation in a clinical trial, there are several important considerations to keep in mind:

1. **Eligibility Criteria**: Understanding the specific eligibility requirements for participation in a trial is crucial, as some trials are designed for patients before, during, or after specific treatments.

2. **Treatment Options**: Families should consider whether the trial offers potential access to treatments not available through standard care.

3. **Potential Risks and Benefits**: It’s important to discuss the potential risks, benefits, and uncertainties of trial participation with healthcare providers.

4. **Impact on Quality of Life**: Families should consider how participation may affect their child's overall health and quality of life, including possible side effects from new and experimental treatments.

5. **Consultation with Healthcare Team**: Decisions about participating in a clinical trial should ideally involve discussions with a pediatric oncologist and other healthcare providers who understand the child’s specific case and the implications of trial involvement.

6. **Ongoing Monitoring**: Participation may require follow-up tests to monitor treatment effectiveness and any long-term effects, which should be factored into the decision-making process.

Overall, clinical trials serve as an important avenue for advancing treatment options for childhood CNS AT/RT while requiring careful consideration from families regarding the potential implications for their child's well-being.",384,"How do clinical trials contribute to the treatment options available for childhood CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and what considerations should families have when deciding to participate?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the role of clinical trials in the treatment of childhood CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor effectively, covering their contribution to treatment options and highlighting key considerations for families when deciding to participate.

                    After a gastrointestinal stromal tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the gastrointestinal tract or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if a gastrointestinal stromal tumor (GIST) spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually GIST cells. The disease is metastatic GIST, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The results of diagnostic and staging tests are used to plan treatment.
                    For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment. However, the treatment of GIST is not based on the stage of the cancer. Treatment is based on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread to other parts of the abdomen or to distant parts of the body.    Treatment is based on whether the tumor is:         -  Resectable: These tumors can be removed by surgery .    -  Unresectable: These tumors cannot be completely removed by surgery.    -  Metastatic and recurrent: Metastatic tumors have spread to other parts of the body. Recurrent tumors have recurred (come back) after treatment. Recurrent GISTs may come back in the gastrointestinal tract or in other parts of the body. They are usually found in the abdomen, peritoneum, and/or liver.    -  Refractory: These tumors have not gotten better with treatment.","When gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) metastasize to another organ, the tumor cells that spread from the primary tumor site travel through the lymphatic system or the bloodstream to form a new tumor in that other organ. Importantly, the metastatic tumor retains the characteristics of the original tumor type. For example, if a GIST spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually GIST cells. Therefore, it would be classified as metastatic GIST rather than liver cancer.",668,"What happens to tumor cells when gastrointestinal stromal tumors metastasize to another organ, and how is this classified in terms of cancer type?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question of what happens to tumor cells when gastrointestinal stromal tumors metastasize, explaining the mechanism of spreading through the lymphatic system or bloodstream. It also correctly emphasizes that the metastatic tumor retains the characteristics of the original tumor type, providing a specific example that aligns with the information in the original answer."

                    - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.    - There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.    - Age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.     - Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs.    Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)   Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information:         -  Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment         Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However, treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy.
                
                
                    There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
                    Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type. The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes:         - Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","Classical Hodgkin lymphoma (cHL) is divided into four distinct subtypes based on the characteristics of the cancer cells when viewed under a microscope. These subtypes are:

1. **Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma**: This subtype is characterized by a high number of lymphocytes relative to other types of cells. It generally has a better prognosis compared to other subtypes.

2. **Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma**: This is the most common subtype of classical Hodgkin lymphoma. It is characterized by the presence of nodular (or sclerotic) areas and often affects young adults, particularly females.

3. **Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma**: This subtype includes a variety of cell types, including Reed-Sternberg cells, and is generally more common in older adults. It tends to have a more diverse cellular composition.

4. **Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma**: This subtype is rare and has a lower number of lymphocytes, often presenting a worse prognosis. It is more often seen in older adults and individuals with immunocompromised conditions.

Each subtype can show different clinical behaviors and responses to treatment, impacting the overall prognosis and management of the disease.",290,Could you provide more information about the subtypes of classical Hodgkin lymphoma and how they differ from each other?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the request for information about the subtypes of classical Hodgkin lymphoma, detailing the four main subtypes and their characteristics.

"Unusual moles, exposure to sunlight, and health history can affect the risk of melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Risk factors for melanoma include the following:         - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.       - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.       - Red or blond hair.              - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.     - Being exposed to certain factors in the environment (in the air, your home or workplace, and your food and water). Some of the environmental risk factors for melanoma are radiation, solvents, vinyl chloride, and PCBs.     - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.     - Having several large or many small moles.    - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).     - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.     - Being white.     - Having a weakened immune system.    - Having certain changes in the genes that are linked to melanoma.        Being white or having a fair complexion increases the risk of melanoma, but anyone can have melanoma, including people with dark skin.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information on risk factors for melanoma:         -  Genetics of Skin Cancer     -  Skin Cancer Prevention","Yes, there are genetic factors that can predispose an individual to melanoma. Specifically, having a family history of melanoma or certain changes in genes linked to melanoma can increase an individual's risk. Additionally, having unusual moles, a fair complexion, and being exposed to environmental factors such as radiation or artificial sunlight can further elevate this risk.

A weakened immune system also plays a significant role in increasing the risk of melanoma. Individuals with a compromised immune system—due to conditions or treatments that affect immune function—are at higher risk for developing melanoma. This is because a strong immune system is essential for detecting and destroying cancer cells, including those that may arise in melanocytes.",144,"Are there genetic factors that can predispose an individual to melanoma, and how does a weakened immune system play a role in this risk?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about genetic factors and weakened immune systems in relation to melanoma, providing clear connections to the original answer regarding family history, genetic changes, and the impact of a compromised immune system. It maintains the critical details and context of the original response, making it fully relevant."
"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.    -   SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 gene testing: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for the SMARCB1 and SMARCA4 genes.
                    Childhood atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is diagnosed and may be removed in surgery. If doctors think there might be a brain tumor, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type of brain tumor. It is often difficult to completely remove AT/RT because of where the tumor is in the brain and because it may already have spread at the time of diagnosis.      The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This test is used to tell the difference between AT/RT and other brain tumors.","MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of Childhood Central Nervous System Atypical Teratoid/Rhabdoid Tumor (AT/RT). It is used to create detailed images of the brain and spinal cord, allowing healthcare providers to detect the presence of tumors and assess their characteristics.

MRI uses a combination of a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to produce a series of detailed pictures, which can reveal the extent and location of the tumor. This imaging technique provides insights about any associated complications and assists in planning the appropriate treatment strategy. The images produced by MRI are essential for identifying abnormalities in the central nervous system, which may indicate the presence of AT/RT.",380,Can you explain the role of MRI in the diagnosis of CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor and what kind of images it produces?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of MRI in diagnosing CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, including the process of creating detailed images and its significance in detecting tumors and planning treatment.

"Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.   The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the brain or to other parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard system for staging childhood craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngioma is described as newly diagnosed disease or recurrent disease. The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose craniopharyngioma are used to help make decisions about treatment.,"The treatment decisions for newly diagnosed and recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma differ in several key ways:

1. **Newly Diagnosed Childhood Craniopharyngioma**: Treatment may include:
   - Surgery (resection) with or without radiation therapy.
   - Partial resection followed by radiation therapy.
   - Cyst drainage with or without radiation therapy or additional surgery.

2. **Recurrent Childhood Craniopharyngioma**: Treatment options depend on the previous treatment and include:
   - Surgery (resection).
   - External-beam radiation therapy.
   - Stereotactic radiosurgery.
   - Intracavitary radiation therapy.
   - Intracavitary chemotherapy or biologic therapy.
   - Intravenous biologic therapy.
   - Cyst drainage.
   - Participation in clinical trials of biologic therapy.

These differences highlight that the approach for recurrent cases is often broader and might include advanced therapies like stereotactic radiosurgery and various forms of chemotherapy and biologic therapy, reflecting the complexity and previous treatments received. Conversely, the treatment for newly diagnosed cases typically focuses more on initial surgical options and immediate interventions.",140,Can you explain how newly diagnosed and recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma differ in terms of treatment decisions?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the differences in treatment decisions between newly diagnosed and recurrent childhood craniopharyngioma.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with oropharyngeal cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with oropharyngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Patients with oropharyngeal cancer should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors with expertise in treating head and neck cancer.
                    The patient's treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. Because the oropharynx helps in breathing, eating, and talking, patients may need special help adjusting to the side effects of the cancer and its treatment. The medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals with special training in the treatment of patients with head and neck cancer. These may include the following specialists:         - Head and neck surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Plastic surgeon.    -  Dentist.    -  Dietitian.    -  Psychologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Speech therapist.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment of all stages of oropharyngeal cancer. A surgeon may remove the cancer and some of the healthy tissue around the cancer. Even if the surgeon removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    New types of surgery, including transoral robotic surgery, are being studied for the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. Transoral robotic surgery may be used to remove cancer from hard-to-reach areas of the mouth and throat. Cameras attached to a robot give a 3-dimensional (3D) image that a surgeon can see. Using a computer, the surgeon guides very small tools at the ends of the robot arms to remove the cancer. This procedure may also be done using an endoscope.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -   Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           In advanced oropharyngeal cancer, dividing the daily dose of radiation into smaller-dose treatments improves the way the tumor responds to treatment. This is called hyperfractionated radiation therapy.    The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat oropharyngeal cancer.    Radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment.     If the thyroid or pituitary gland are part of the radiation treatment area, the patient has an increased risk of hypothyroidism (too little thyroid hormone). A blood test to check the thyroid hormone level in the body should be done before and after treatment.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Systemic chemotherapy is used to treat oropharyngeal cancer.    See Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer for more information. (Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibodies are a type of targeted therapy being used in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances in the blood or tissues that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     Cetuximab is a type of monoclonal antibody that works by binding to a protein on the surface of the cancer cells and stops the cells from growing and dividing. It is used in the treatment of recurrent oropharyngeal cancer.    Other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in the treatment of oropharyngeal cancer. Nivolumab is being studied in the treatment of stage III and IV oropharyngeal cancer.    See Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer for more information. (Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   Following treatment, it is important to have careful head and neck exams to look for signs that the cancer has come back. Check-ups will be done every 6 to 12 weeks in the first year, every 3 months in the second year, every 3 to 4 months in the third year, and every 6 months thereafter.

1. **Treatment Timing**: Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. They should consider their current treatment status and whether a clinical trial aligns with their treatment timeline.

2. **Type of Trial**: Some clinical trials are designed specifically for patients who have not yet started treatment, while others may focus on those whose cancer has not improved with current therapies. Patients should investigate which type of trial they may qualify for based on their condition.

3. **Purpose of the Trial**: Clinical trials aim to test new treatments or methods that could be safer or more effective than standard treatments. Patients should understand the purpose of the trial and whether it might offer them potential benefits compared to existing options.

4. **Participation Consequences**: Participation may involve receiving either standard treatment or new approaches that are experimental. Patients should be aware of the potential risks and benefits of these new treatments.

5. **Eligibility Criteria**: Each clinical trial has specific eligibility criteria. Patients need to assess whether they meet these criteria and what that entails in terms of their particular diagnosis and overall health.

6. **Help Advance Research**: Patients should consider the role of clinical trials in contributing to the advancement of cancer treatments, which might help future patients while also providing them with access to innovative therapies.

7. **Potential for Follow-Up Tests**: Trials may require additional follow-up tests, and patients should be prepared for this aspect of participation, understanding that these tests can help assess the effectiveness of the treatment being studied.

8. **Consultation with Healthcare Providers**: It is crucial for patients to discuss with their healthcare team, including their medical oncologist and other specialists, to determine the suitability of clinical trial participation in the context of their overall treatment plan.

By weighing these considerations, patients can make informed decisions about participating in clinical trials for oropharyngeal cancer.",333,What factors should patients consider when deciding to participate in a clinical trial for oropharyngeal cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer comprehensively addresses factors related to participation in clinical trials specifically for oropharyngeal cancer.

"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to diagnose adult brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). Any loss of vision may be a sign of a tumor that has damaged or pressed on the parts of the brain that affect eyesight.     -   Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. This test may be done to diagnose a germ cell tumor.    -   Gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for changes in a chromosome that has been linked with a certain type of brain tumor. This test may be done to diagnose an inherited syndrome.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI is often used to diagnose tumors in the spinal cord. Sometimes a procedure called magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the MRI scan. An MRS is used to diagnose tumors, based on their chemical make-up.     -   SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan. SPECT is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET is used to tell the difference between a primary tumor and a tumor that has spread to the brain from somewhere else in the body.
                    A biopsy is also used to diagnose a brain tumor. If imaging tests show there may be a brain tumor, a biopsy is usually done. One of the following types of biopsies may be used:          -   Stereotactic biopsy : When imaging tests show there may be a tumor deep in the brain in a hard to reach place, a stereotactic brain biopsy may be done. This kind of biopsy uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find the tumor and guide the needle used to remove the tissue. A small incision is made in the scalp and a small hole is drilled through the skull. A biopsy needle is inserted through the hole to remove cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.    -   Open biopsy : When imaging tests show that there may be a tumor that can be removed by surgery, an open biopsy may be done. A part of the skull is removed in an operation called a craniotomy. A sample of brain tissue is removed and viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If cancer cells are found, some or all of the tumor may be removed during the same surgery. Tests are done before surgery to find the areas around the tumor that are important for normal brain function. There are also ways to test brain function during surgery. The doctor will use the results of these tests to remove as much of the tumor as possible with the least damage to normal tissue in the brain.         The pathologist checks the biopsy sample to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how the tumor cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.    The following tests may be done on the tumor tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.    -   Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.     -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.           Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done.    For some tumors, a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed and treated based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.    Sometimes the results of imaging tests and other procedures show that the tumor is very likely to be benign and a biopsy is not done.","The context provided does not include specific information on the role of gene testing in the diagnosis of adult brain tumors.

                    Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.
                    The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes. Each lobe has many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts.      Each breast also has blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels carry lymph between lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter substances in lymph and help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest.
                
                
                    It may be difficult to detect (find) breast cancer early in pregnant or nursing women.
                    The breasts usually get larger, tender, or lumpy in women who are pregnant, nursing, or have just given birth. This occurs because of normal hormone changes that take place during pregnancy. These changes can make small lumps difficult to detect. The breasts may also become denser. It is more difficult to detect breast cancer in women with dense breasts using mammography. Because these breast changes can delay diagnosis, breast cancer is often found at a later stage in these women.

		                    - Lactation (breast milk production) and breast-feeding should be stopped if surgery or chemotherapy is planned.     - Breast cancer does not appear to harm the unborn baby.    - Pregnancy does not seem to affect the survival of women who have had breast cancer in the past.
		                
		                
		                    Lactation (breast milk production) and breast-feeding should be stopped if surgery or chemotherapy is planned.
		                    If surgery is planned, breast-feeding should be stopped to reduce blood flow in the breasts and make them smaller. Breast-feeding should also be stopped if chemotherapy is planned. Many anticancer drugs, especially cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, may occur in high levels in breast milk and may harm the nursing baby. Women receiving chemotherapy should not breast-feed. Stopping lactation does not improve the mother's prognosis.

		                    Pregnancy does not seem to affect the survival of women who have had breast cancer in the past.
		                    For women who have had breast cancer, pregnancy does not seem to affect their survival. However, some doctors recommend that a woman wait 2 years after treatment for breast cancer before trying to have a baby, so that any early return of the cancer would be detected. This may affect a womans decision to become pregnant. The unborn baby does not seem to be affected if the mother has had breast cancer.","It is recommended to stop lactation and breastfeeding if a woman is undergoing surgery or chemotherapy for breast cancer for several reasons:

1. **Surgery Preparation**: Stopping breastfeeding helps to reduce blood flow in the breasts, which may facilitate the surgical process and make the breasts smaller.
2. **Chemotherapy Concerns**: Many anticancer drugs, particularly cyclophosphamide and methotrexate, can be found in high levels in breast milk and may pose a risk to a nursing baby. Therefore, it is advised that women receiving chemotherapy should not breast-feed.

Overall, stopping lactation does not improve the mother's prognosis, but it is primarily recommended to ensure the safety of the nursing infant during treatment.",658,Why is it recommended to stop lactation and breastfeeding if a woman is undergoing surgery or chemotherapy for breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects the information provided in the original answer regarding the reasons to stop lactation and breastfeeding during surgery or chemotherapy for breast cancer.

"Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk of a central nervous system tumor. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. There are few known risk factors for brain tumors. The following conditions may increase the risk of certain types of brain tumors:          - Being exposed to vinyl chloride may increase the risk of glioma.    -  Infection with the Epstein-Barr virus, having AIDS (acquired immunodeficiency syndrome), or receiving an organ transplant may increase the risk of primary CNS lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma for more information.)    - Having certain genetic syndromes may increase the risk brain tumors:               -  Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or 2 (NF2).      -  von Hippel-Lindau disease.      -  Tuberous sclerosis.      -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome.      - Turcot syndrome type 1 or 2.      -  Nevoid basal cell carcinoma syndrome.","Organ transplantation is considered a known risk factor for developing primary CNS lymphoma because it can lead to a weakened immune system. Patients who have undergone organ transplants are susceptible to infections and certain cancers, including primary CNS lymphoma, due to the immunosuppressive therapies they require to prevent organ rejection. This weakened immune response may permit malignant lymphocytes to grow and form tumors in the central nervous system.

Preventative measures that can be discussed with a healthcare provider include:

1. **Monitoring and Screening**: Regular check-ups and imaging tests might be recommended to monitor for any early signs of lymphoma.
  
2. **Immunosuppressive Management**: Adjusting the immunosuppressive regimen post-transplant to balance the risk of rejection and the potential increase in cancer risk.

3. **Education on Symptoms**: Patients should be educated about the symptoms of CNS lymphoma so that they can report any unusual neurological changes promptly.

4. **Participating in Clinical Trials**: Engaging in clinical trials that focus on innovative treatments or preventive strategies for those at high risk can also be considered.

5. **Healthy Lifestyle Choices**: Recommendations for a healthy diet, regular exercise, and avoiding tobacco use may also contribute to the overall health of the immune system and reduce general cancer risk. 

These discussions should be tailored to the individual based on their health status and history of organ transplantation.",312,"How do known risk factors like organ transplantation correlate with the chances of developing primary CNS lymphoma, and what preventative measures can be discussed with a healthcare provider?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies organ transplantation as a risk factor for primary CNS lymphoma and provides detailed explanations about the implications of immunosuppressive therapy.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The type of plasma cell neoplasm.    - The stage of the disease.    - Whether a certain immunoglobulin (antibody) is present.    - Whether there are certain genetic changes.    - Whether the kidney is damaged.    - Whether the cancer responds to initial treatment or recurs (comes back).        Treatment options depend on the following:         - The type of plasma cell neoplasm.    - The age and general health of the patient.    - Whether there are signs, symptoms, or health problems, such as kidney failure or infection, related to the disease.    - Whether the cancer responds to initial treatment or recurs (comes back).","The different types of plasma cell neoplasms significantly influence the prognosis of the disease. The prognosis (chance of recovery) can vary based on several factors, including:

1. **Type of Neoplasm**: Different plasma cell neoplasms, such as Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS), plasmacytoma, and multiple myeloma, have different implications for prognosis. For instance, MGUS is generally benign but has the potential to progress to more serious conditions like multiple myeloma or amyloidosis.

2. **Stage of Disease**: The stage of multiple myeloma, determined by specific blood markers such as beta-2-microglobulin and albumin levels, is crucial. There are three stages of multiple myeloma, with Stage I indicating a better prognosis than Stages II and III, where the disease is more advanced.

3. **Other Factors**: The presence of certain immunoglobulins, genetic changes, kidney damage, and the response to initial treatment or recurrence of the disease also influence prognosis.

"Tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord are used to detect (find) and diagnose primary CNS lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -   Slit-lamp eye exam : An exam that uses a special microscope with a bright, narrow slit of light to check the outside and inside of the eye.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.     -   Stereotactic biopsy : A biopsy procedure that uses a computer and a 3-dimensional (3-D) scanning device to find a tumor site and guide the removal of tissue so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The following tests may be done on the samples of tissue that are removed:                -  Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light.      -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.      -  Cytogenetic analysis: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. Other tests, such as fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), may also be done to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.             -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells and platelets.      -  The number and type of white blood cells.      -  The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      -  The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.               -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.","Blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry studies, play a supportive role in the diagnostic process for primary CNS lymphoma by helping to evaluate the overall health of the patient and the presence of specific abnormalities. For instance, a CBC can assess the number and types of blood cells, indicating potential issues like anemia or changes in white blood cell counts that could suggest malignancy. Blood chemistry studies measure substances released into the blood by organs and tissues, and unusual levels may indicate disease activity or organ dysfunction associated with cancer. Although these tests are not definitive for diagnosing primary CNS lymphoma, they provide valuable information that can assist in the overall clinical assessment and guide further diagnostic procedures.",435,"What role do blood tests, such as a complete blood count (CBC) and blood chemistry studies, play in the diagnostic process for primary CNS lymphoma?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the role of blood tests, including CBC and blood chemistry studies, in diagnosing primary CNS lymphoma, aligning with the details provided in the original answer.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken. The doctor will ask if there is a family history of retinoblastoma.    -  Eye exam with dilated pupil: An exam of the eye in which the pupil is dilated (opened wider) with medicated eye drops to allow the doctor to look through the lens and pupil to the retina. The inside of the eye, including the retina and the optic nerve, is examined with a light. Depending on the age of the child, this exam may be done under anesthesia. There are several types of eye exams that are done with the pupil dilated:               -  Ophthalmoscopy : An exam of the inside of the back of the eye to check the retina and optic nerve using a small magnifying lens and a light.      -  Slit-lamp biomicroscopy : An exam of the inside of the eye to check the retina, optic nerve, and other parts of the eye using a strong beam of light and a microscope.      - Fluorescein angiography : A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood inside the eye. An orange fluorescent dye called fluorescein is injected into a blood vessel in the arm and goes into the bloodstream. As the dye travels through blood vessels of the eye, a special camera takes pictures of the retina and choroid to find any blood vessels that are blocked or leaking.              -   RB1 gene test: A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for a change in the RB1 gene.    -   Ultrasound exam of the eye: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off the internal tissues of the eye to make echoes. Eye drops are used to numb the eye and a small probe that sends and receives sound waves is placed gently on the surface of the eye. The echoes make a picture of the inside of the eye and the distance from the cornea to the retina is measured. The picture, called a sonogram, shows on the screen of the ultrasound monitor. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the eye, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.        Retinoblastoma can usually be diagnosed without a biopsy.

                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with colon cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.

                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following types of surgery:            -  Local excision: If the cancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. Instead, the doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This is called a local excision. If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small bulging area of tissue), the operation is called a polypectomy.     -  Resection of the colon with anastomosis: If the cancer is larger, the doctor will perform a partial colectomy (removing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it). The doctor may then perform an anastomosis (sewing the healthy parts of the colon together). The doctor will also usually remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer.     - Resection of the colon with colostomy: If the doctor is not able to sew the 2 ends of the colon back together, a stoma (an opening) is made on the outside of the body for waste to pass through. This procedure is called a colostomy. A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste. Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. If the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon, however, the colostomy may be permanent.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiofrequency ablation      Radiofrequency ablation is the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.       Cryosurgery     Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver. This involves blocking the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver. The livers arteries then deliver the drugs throughout the liver. Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery. The liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of colon cancer include the following:            -  Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.                  -  Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.       -  Cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of some types of cancer cells. This may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing.                -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                   -  Ziv-aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors.       -  Regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment. It blocks the action of certain proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                      See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","Chemotherapy is an essential treatment modality for advanced stages of colon cancer, particularly in stages III and IV. The primary purpose of chemotherapy in these stages is to kill cancer cells that may have spread from the primary tumor to the lymph nodes or other distant organs, as well as to shrink tumors before surgical procedures. 

In stage III colon cancer, where the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes but not to distant sites, chemotherapy is often administered after surgical resection to eliminate any residual cancer cells. This additional treatment, known as adjuvant chemotherapy, reduces the risk of cancer recurrence.

When it comes to stage IV colon cancer, which indicates that the cancer has metastasized to distant organs such as the liver or lungs, chemotherapy becomes a systemic treatment. It can be delivered through intravenous infusion or oral medication, allowing the drugs to circulate throughout the body. This systemic chemotherapy targets cancer cells that have spread and is often used in conjunction with targeted therapies and possibly prior to surgery in some cases to shrink tumors.

The mechanisms by which chemotherapy works include either killing the cancer cells directly or preventing them from dividing and growing. This is achieved through various chemotherapeutic agents that interfere with the cancer cell's ability to replicate their DNA or manage their cellular functions. The choice of specific chemotherapy drugs and regimens, and their administration, depend on the cancer's characteristics and the overall health of the patient. 

Ultimately, the goal of chemotherapy in these advanced stages is to prolong survival and improve the quality of life for individuals affected by colon cancer.",188,"Can you explain the purpose and mechanisms of chemotherapy in treating advanced stages of colon cancer, specifically stage III and IV?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the purpose and mechanisms of chemotherapy in treating advanced stages of colon cancer, specifically stage III and IV, aligning closely with the original answer's details. It includes information about adjuvant chemotherapy for stage III and mentions the systemic nature of treatment for stage IV, which matches the original answer's emphasis on the use and goals of chemotherapy in various cancer stages."
"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may receive new treatment options that are not yet widely available, which could potentially be more effective than standard therapies.

2. **Contribution to Research**: Participation helps improve the understanding of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors and can contribute to the development of better treatments for future patients.

3. **Standard and Experimental Options**: Patients in clinical trials may still have access to standard treatments while also being among the first to receive new therapies that are being tested for safety and efficacy.

4. **Comprehensive Care**: Clinical trials often involve a carefully coordinated approach by a team of healthcare providers specializing in childhood cancer, ensuring that treatment is overseen by experts in the field.

5. **Follow-Up and Monitoring**: Many clinical trials include detailed follow-up and monitoring, providing patients with close observation of their health and treatment responses.

6. **Potential for Better Outcomes**: Some trials aim to find more effective treatment methods, which may lead to improved prognoses compared to traditional treatments.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - The stage of the cancer (whether it is in the endometrium only, involves the uterus wall, or has spread to other places in the body).    - How the cancer cells look under a microscope.     - Whether the cancer cells are affected by progesterone.         Endometrial cancer can usually be cured because it is usually diagnosed early.","The stage of endometrial cancer significantly impacts both the chance of recovery and the potential treatment strategies. 

**Chance of Recovery:**
- The prognosis (chance of recovery) largely depends on the stage of the cancer, which describes how far the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body. Early-stage endometrial cancer (Stage I) is often associated with a better chance of recovery, as it is usually diagnosed at an earlier point when the cancer is confined to the uterus. In contrast, higher stages (Stage III and IV) indicate that the cancer has spread beyond the uterus, which generally decreases the likelihood of a favorable outcome.

**Potential Treatment Strategies:**
- Treatment strategies vary based on the stage of endometrial cancer:
  - **Stage I and II Cancer:**
    - For low-risk endometrial cancer (Grades 1 and 2), treatment generally involves surgery, such as total hysterectomy, possibly followed by radiation therapy or participation in clinical trials for chemotherapy.
    - For high-risk cancers (Grade 3), treatment may include a radical hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.

  - **Stage III and IV Cancer:**
    - Advanced stages of cancer typically require more aggressive treatments. The standard approach may include surgery alongside adjuvant chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy. For those unable to undergo surgery, alternatives such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy are considered.
    - Targeted therapies, such as mTOR inhibitors or monoclonal antibody therapy, may also be options for treatment in these later stages.

In summary, the stage of endometrial cancer not only influences the potential for recovery but also dictates specific treatment methodologies that are tailored to the extent of disease progression.",32,How does the stage of endometrial cancer impact the chance of recovery and the potential treatment strategies?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of the stage of endometrial cancer on both the chance of recovery and potential treatment strategies, which aligns closely with the original answer's focus on how prognosis and treatment options are influenced by cancer stage.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with pancreatic cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     One of the following types of surgery may be used to take out the tumor:            -  Whipple procedure: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, and the bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to produce digestive juices and insulin.     -  Total pancreatectomy: This operation removes the whole pancreas, part of the stomach, part of the small intestine, the common bile duct, the gallbladder, the spleen, and nearby lymph nodes.     -  Distal pancreatectomy: The body and the tail of the pancreas and usually the spleen are removed.           If the cancer has spread and cannot be removed, the following types of palliative surgery may be done to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life:            - Surgical biliary bypass: If cancer is blocking the small intestine and bile is building up in the gallbladder, a biliary bypass may be done. During this operation, the doctor will cut the gallbladder or bile duct and sew it to the small intestine to create a new pathway around the blocked area.      -  Endoscopic stent placement: If the tumor is blocking the bile duct, surgery may be done to put in a stent (a thin tube) to drain bile that has built up in the area. The doctor may place the stent through a catheter that drains to the outside of the body or the stent may go around the blocked area and drain the bile into the small intestine.      -  Gastric bypass: If the tumor is blocking the flow of food from the stomach, the stomach may be sewn directly to the small intestine so the patient can continue to eat normally.               Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat pancreatic cancer.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.     See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information.       Chemoradiation therapy     Chemoradiation therapy combines chemotherapy and radiation therapy to increase the effects of both.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Erlotinib is a type of TKI used to treat pancreatic cancer.    See Drugs Approved for Pancreatic Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    There are treatments for pain caused by pancreatic cancer.
                    Pain can occur when the tumor presses on nerves or other organs near the pancreas. When pain medicine is not enough, there are treatments that act on nerves in the abdomen to relieve the pain. The doctor may inject medicine into the area around affected nerves or may cut the nerves to block the feeling of pain. Radiation therapy with or without chemotherapy can also help relieve pain by shrinking the tumor. See the PDQ summary on Cancer Pain for more information.
                
                
                    Patients with pancreatic cancer have special nutritional needs.
                    Surgery to remove the pancreas may affect its ability to make pancreatic enzymes that help to digest food. As a result, patients may have problems digesting food and absorbing nutrients into the body. To prevent malnutrition, the doctor may prescribe medicines that replace these enzymes. See the PDQ summary on Nutrition in Cancer Care for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.

Many of today's established treatments have been developed through the findings of earlier clinical trials, thereby advancing cancer care.

When deciding to participate in a clinical trial, patients should consider several factors:

1. **Timing**: Patients can enter trials before, during, or after their cancer treatment. It's important to identify which trials are applicable based on their treatment timeline.
   
2. **Eligibility**: Some clinical trials may only be open to patients who have not started treatment, while others might take patients at different stages of their disease.

3. **Type of Trial**: Understanding what the trial is testing—whether it's a new drug, combination therapy, or a different treatment approach—can help patients make informed decisions.

4. **Potential Benefits and Risks**: Participating may provide access to new and potentially more effective treatments, but patients should also consider the risks and uncertainties associated with experimental therapies.

5. **Doctor's Recommendation**: Discussing with a healthcare provider about the suitability of a clinical trial based on individual health and cancer characteristics is essential for making an informed decision.

Overall, clinical trials offer promising avenues for novel treatments that may enhance patient outcomes and contribute to future advancements in pancreatic cancer therapies.",677,"In what ways do clinical trials contribute to the treatment options available for pancreatic cancer, and what factors should patients consider when deciding to participate in a trial?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the role of clinical trials in advancing treatment options for pancreatic cancer, aligning well with the original answer's emphasis on the significance of clinical trials.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.     Surgery is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.
                
                
                    Three standard treatments are used:
                    Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain, external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called whole brain radiation therapy.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether the patient has primary CNS lymphoma and AIDS. External radiation therapy is used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.     High-dose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue and cause disorders that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, speech, reading, writing, and memory. Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the CNS or eye. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy and/or intraventricular chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles (fluid -filled cavities) of the brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside the eye.     A network of blood vessels and tissue, called the blood-brain barrier, protects the brain from harmful substances. This barrier can also keep anticancer drugs from reaching the brain. In order to treat CNS lymphoma, certain drugs may be used to make openings between cells in the blood-brain barrier. This is called blood-brain barrier disruption. Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain.         Steroid therapy     Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

1. **External Radiation Therapy**: This involves using a machine outside the body to direct radiation toward the cancer. In the case of primary CNS lymphoma, external radiation therapy is administered as whole brain radiation therapy because the cancer tends to spread throughout the brain.

2. **Internal Radiation Therapy**: This involves placing a radioactive substance directly into or near the cancer using needles, seeds, wires, or catheters. However, it is not indicated for treating primary CNS lymphoma.

The primary approach for radiation therapy in primary CNS lymphoma is whole brain radiation therapy via external methods, aimed at addressing the widespread nature of the disease in the brain. Internal radiation therapy is not commonly applied in this specific context. The choice of radiation therapy may depend on factors like whether the patient has AIDS and the potential side effects, as high-dose radiation can damage healthy brain tissues.",438,"What are the different types of radiation therapy used for treating primary CNS lymphoma, and how do they differ in application?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the types of radiation therapy used for treating primary CNS lymphoma, specifically highlighting external radiation therapy (whole brain radiation therapy) and internal radiation therapy.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Treatment of GI carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery. One of the following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Endoscopic resection: Surgery to remove a small tumor that is on the inside lining of the GI tract. An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus to the stomach and sometimes, the duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool for removing tumor tissue.     -  Local excision: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it.      -  Resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the organ that contains cancer. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.     -  Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy carcinoid tumor tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument.      -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that release high-energy radio waves (similar to microwaves) that kill cancer cells. The probe may be inserted through the skin or through an incision (cut) in the abdomen.     -  Liver transplant: Surgery to remove the whole liver and replace it with a healthy donated liver.     -  Hepatic artery embolization: A procedure to embolize (block) the hepatic artery, which is the main blood vessel that brings blood into the liver. Blocking the flow of blood to the liver helps kill cancer cells growing there.               Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy. Radiation is given to the tumor using a drug that has a radioactive substance, such as iodine I 131, attached to it. The radioactive substance kills the tumor cells.     External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery is a type of regional chemotherapy that may be used to treat a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor that has spread to the liver. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that embolizes (blocks) the artery, and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue is a treatment that stops extra hormones from being made. GI carcinoid tumors are treated with octreotide or lanreotide which are injected under the skin or into the muscle. Octreotide and lanreotide may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth.
                
                
                    Treatment for carcinoid syndrome may also be needed.
                    Treatment of carcinoid syndrome may include the following:          - Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue stops extra hormones from being made. Carcinoid syndrome is treated with octreotide or lanreotide to lessen flushing and diarrhea. Octreotide and lanreotide may also help slow tumor growth.     -  Interferon therapy stimulates the bodys immune system to work better and lessens flushing and diarrhea. Interferon may also help slow tumor growth.    - Taking medicine for diarrhea.    - Taking medicine for skin rashes.    - Taking medicine to breathe easier.    - Taking medicine before having anesthesia for a medical procedure.        Other ways to help treat carcinoid syndrome include avoiding things that cause flushing or difficulty breathing such as alcohol, nuts, certain cheeses and foods with capsaicin, such as chili peppers. Avoiding stressful situations and certain types of physical activity can also help treat carcinoid syndrome.   For some patients with carcinoid heart syndrome, a heart valve replacement may be done.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Several types of targeted therapy are being studied in the treatment of GI carcinoid tumors.

1. **Carcinoid Tumors in the Stomach**:
   - For small tumors, endoscopic surgery (resection) may be performed.
   - Larger tumors may require surgery (resection) to remove part or all of the stomach, along with nearby lymph nodes if necessary.

2. **Carcinoid Tumors in the Small Intestine**:
   - In the duodenum, small tumors may be treated with endoscopic surgery, while slightly larger tumors may require local excision.
   - Tumors in the jejunum and ileum typically require surgical resection to remove the tumor and associated lymph nodes, along with potential follow-up surgeries if any tumor remains.

3. **Carcinoid Tumors in the Appendix**:
   - Treatment usually involves surgery (resection) to remove the appendix. In some cases, this may include resection of the right side of the colon as well.

The primary difference lies in the specific surgical options and requirements based on tumor size, aggressiveness, and associated lymph node involvement, indicating a tailored approach to treatment based on the tumor's location and characteristics.",79,"How does the treatment approach differ for carcinoid tumors located in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, such as the stomach versus the small intestine or appendix?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed overview of the treatment approaches for carcinoid tumors located in various parts of the gastrointestinal tract, including the stomach, small intestine, and appendix.

                    Uterine sarcoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the muscles of the uterus or other tissues that support the uterus.
                    The uterus is part of the female reproductive system. The uterus is the hollow, pear-shaped organ in the pelvis, where a fetus grows. The cervix is at the lower, narrow end of the uterus, and leads to the vagina.       Uterine sarcoma is a very rare kind of cancer that forms in the uterine muscles or in tissues that support the uterus. (Information about other types of sarcomas can be found in the PDQ summary on Adult Soft Tissue Sarcoma Treatment.) Uterine sarcoma is different from cancer of the endometrium, a disease in which cancer cells start growing inside the lining of the uterus. (See the PDQ summary on Endometrial Cancer Treatment for information).","Uterine sarcoma is characterized by the formation of malignant cells in the muscles of the uterus or other supportive tissues. It is a very rare type of cancer. Signs include abnormal bleeding, and risk factors include exposure to x-rays and past treatment with radiation therapy to the pelvis. Diagnosis typically involves tests examining the uterus.

In contrast, endometrial cancer develops from malignant cells in the tissues of the endometrium, which is the lining of the uterus. It is the most common invasive cancer of the female reproductive system, primarily affecting postmenopausal women. Symptoms often include unusual vaginal bleeding or pelvic pain. 

The key distinction between the two is that uterine sarcoma originates in the muscular tissues of the uterus, while endometrial cancer arises in the inner lining.",8,What are the main characteristics that define uterine sarcoma and how does it differ from endometrial cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the characteristics of uterine sarcoma as described in the original answer, including its definition, signs, risk factors, and the distinction between uterine sarcoma and endometrial cancer.

                    After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver, to nearby tissues or organs, or to other parts of the body is called staging. In childhood liver cancer, the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment. The results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.
                
                
                    There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.
                    Two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer:         - The PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment.    - The POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment.
                
                
                    There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups:
                    The liver is divided into 4 sections. The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer.     PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I     In group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II     In group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III     In group III, one of the following is true:            -  Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer.     - Cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.              PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV     In group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells. The disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer.","The PRETEXT grouping system is significant in the treatment planning for childhood liver cancer as it categorizes the extent of the tumor based on the sections of the liver involved before treatment begins. Specifically, the liver is divided into four sections, and the PRETEXT groups range from I to IV, depending on how many sections contain cancer:

- **Group I**: Cancer is found in one section of the liver.
- **Group II**: Cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver, but two adjacent sections are cancer-free.
- **Group III**: Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section is free of cancer, or in two sections that are not next to each other, leaving two sections free of cancer.
- **Group IV**: Cancer is present in all four sections of the liver.

These groups are essential for determining treatment options and strategies, as they provide vital information on how localized or extensive the cancer is, which influences the feasibility of surgical removal and the overall approach to treatment. The PRETEXT group is considered along with other factors such as the cancer’s response to chemotherapy and whether it has spread to other areas, ultimately guiding the care plan tailored to each child’s specific needs.",611,Can you explain the significance of the PRETEXT grouping system in relation to childhood liver cancer treatment planning?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively explains the significance of the PRETEXT grouping system in relation to childhood liver cancer treatment planning.

                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose non-Hodgkin lymphoma may also be used for staging. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system.

No cancer is found in the abdomen or mediastinum (area between the lungs).       Stage II     In stage II childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in one area outside the lymph nodes and in nearby lymph nodes; or     - in two or more areas either above or below the diaphragm, and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to have started in the stomach or intestines and can be completely removed by surgery. Cancer may have spread to certain nearby lymph nodes.              Stage III     In stage III childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found:            - in at least one area above the diaphragm and in at least one area below the diaphragm; or     - to have started in the chest; or     - to have started in the abdomen and spread throughout the abdomen; or     - in the area around the spine.              Stage IV     In stage IV childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer is found in the bone marrow, brain, or cerebrospinal fluid. Cancer may also be found in other parts of the body.","The staging process in childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is crucial as it determines whether and how the cancer has spread within the lymphatic system or to other parts of the body. This process involves conducting tests that yield vital information about the extent of the disease. The stages of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma range from Stage I, where the cancer is localized to one group of lymph nodes or one area outside lymph nodes, to Stage IV, where the cancer has spread to the bone marrow, brain, or cerebrospinal fluid, among other areas.

Knowing the stage of the disease is essential for treatment planning because it influences the choice of therapeutic strategies. Different stages may necessitate varying treatment approaches, including combinations of chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or other modalities. The results from the staging tests, which may include procedures like bone scans and imaging studies, guide the medical team in devising a tailored treatment plan that addresses the specific needs according to the spread and severity of the lymphoma. Thus, proper staging directly impacts the prognosis and the overall treatment approach for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",431,Could you explain the significance of the staging process in childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma and how it influences treatment planning?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the significance of the staging process in childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma and its influence on treatment planning.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether the tumor is nonseminoma or seminoma.    - The size of the tumor and where it is in the body.     - The blood levels of AFP, -hCG, and LDH.    - Whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.    - The way the tumor responds to initial treatment.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).","Blood markers such as AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein), -hCG (Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin), and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) play a crucial role in determining the prognosis of patients with Extragonadal Germ Cell Tumors. The levels of these tumor markers help categorize patients into prognostic groups that influence treatment planning:

1. **Good Prognosis**: 
   - For nonseminoma tumors to be classified in this group, the levels of AFP and -hCG must be normal, and LDH should be slightly above normal. 
   - For seminoma tumors, the AFP level must be normal; -hCG and LDH can be at any level.

2. **Intermediate Prognosis**: 
   - Nonseminoma tumors fall into this category if any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is more than slightly above normal.
   - For seminomas, if the tumor has spread beyond the lungs but the AFP level remains normal, -hCG and LDH can be at any level.

3. **Poor Prognosis**: 
   - Nonseminoma tumors are considered poor prognosis if any of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) are high, or if the tumor is located in the chest or has spread to other organs beyond the lungs.

The assessment of these blood markers is vital for determining the extent of disease, planning subsequent treatments, and evaluating the overall treatment response.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:            -  Wide local excision: The cancer is cut from the skin along with some of the tissue around it. A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection also may be done.     - Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; for a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.

                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

It uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or inhibit their growth. There are two types of radiation therapy utilized in the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma:

1. **External Radiation Therapy**: This method employs a machine outside the body to deliver radiation beams directly to the cancerous area. It is often used to target the tumor site after surgical removal to eliminate any residual cancer cells and reduce the risk of recurrence.

2. **Internal Radiation Therapy**: Also known as brachytherapy, this involves placing a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters directly into or near the tumor. However, the context provided does not specify how frequently this method is used specifically for Merkel cell carcinoma.

Radiation therapy may also serve a palliative purpose in advanced stages of the disease, helping to alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. The approach to radiation therapy will depend on the type and stage of the Merkel cell carcinoma being treated.",159,Can you explain the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma and the different types that are used?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the role of radiation therapy in the treatment of Merkel cell carcinoma, detailing its significance as adjuvant therapy and its two types: external and internal radiation therapy.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with adult soft tissue sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is the most common treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma. For some soft-tissue sarcomas, removal of the tumor in surgery may be the only treatment needed. The following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Mohs microsurgery: A procedure in which the tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used where appearance is important, such as on the skin.      -  Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it. For tumors of the head, neck, abdomen, and trunk, as little normal tissue as possible is removed.     -  Limb-sparing surgery: Removal of the tumor in an arm or leg without amputation, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first to shrink the tumor. The tumor is then removed in a wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an implant such as artificial bone.      -  Amputation: Surgery to remove part or all of a limb or appendage, such as an arm or leg. Amputation is rarely used to treat soft tissue sarcoma of the arm or leg.     -  Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymph node dissection.           Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given before or after surgery to remove the tumor. When given before surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will make the tumor smaller and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called neoadjuvant therapy. When given after surgery, radiation therapy or chemotherapy will kill any remaining cancer cells. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles. This type of external radiation therapy causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue and is less likely to cause dry mouth, trouble swallowing, and damage to the skin.    The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy and internal radiation therapy may be used to treat adult soft tissue sarcoma.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Regional chemotherapy     Clinical trials are studying ways to improve the effect of chemotherapy on tumor cells, including the following:             -  Regional hyperthermia therapy: A treatment in which tissue around the tumor is exposed to high temperatures to damage and kill cancer cells or to make cancer cells more sensitive to chemotherapy.     -  Isolated limb perfusion: A procedure that sends chemotherapy directly to an arm or leg in which the cancer has formed. The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet, and anticancer drugs are put directly into the blood of the limb. This sends a high dose of drugs to the tumor.
                
                
                    Treatment for adult soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.

1. **Purpose**: 
   - **Before Surgery (Neoadjuvant Therapy)**: When radiation therapy is administered before surgery, its primary purpose is to shrink the tumor to reduce the extent of surgery needed. This can make surgical removal easier and preserve surrounding healthy tissue.
   - **After Surgery (Adjuvant Therapy)**: Radiation therapy given after surgery aims to kill any remaining cancer cells that may not have been removed during the surgical procedure. This helps to lower the risk of cancer recurrence.

2. **Timing**: 
   - Radiation therapy can be incorporated into the treatment plan at different stages depending on the specific circumstances of the patient's condition, including the size and location of the tumor, as well as the overall treatment strategy devised by the healthcare team. 

In summary, radiation therapy is strategically timed to enhance the effectiveness of surgical interventions in treating adult soft tissue sarcoma, either preceding surgery to reduce tumor size or following surgery to eliminate residual cancer cells.",728,Can you explain the purpose and timing of radiation therapy in the treatment process for adult soft tissue sarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively explains the purpose and timing of radiation therapy in the treatment of adult soft tissue sarcoma.

                    Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes a large number of abnormal blood cells.
                    Childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia. Cancers that are acute usually get worse quickly if they are not treated. Cancers that are chronic usually get worse slowly.
                
                
                    Leukemia and other diseases of the blood and bone marrow may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.    A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.         In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts, or leukemia cells, in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. The leukemia cells can build up in the blood and bone marrow so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. Sometimes leukemia cells form a solid tumor called a granulocytic sarcoma or chloroma.   There are subtypes of AML based on the type of blood cell that is affected. The treatment of AML is different when it is a subtype called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) or when the child has Down syndrome.
                
                
                    Other myeloid diseases can affect the blood and bone marrow.
                    Chronic myelogenous leukemia    In chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), too many bone marrow stem cells become a type of white blood cell called granulocytes. Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These are called blasts. Over time, the granulocytes and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. CML is rare in children.        Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia     Juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML) is a rare childhood cancer that occurs more often in children around the age of 2 years and is more common in boys. In JMML, too many bone marrow stem cells become 2 types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these bone marrow stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature cells, called blasts, are unable to do their usual work. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.       Myelodysplastic syndromes     Myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS) occur less often in children than in adults. In MDS, the bone marrow makes too few red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. These blood cells may not mature and enter the blood. The treatment for MDS depends on how low the numbers of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are. Over time, MDS may become AML.    Transient myeloproliferative disorder (TMD) is a type of MDS. This disorder of the bone marrow can develop in newborns who have Down syndrome. It usually goes away on its own within the first 3 weeks of life. Infants who have Down syndrome and TMD have an increased chance of developing AML before the age of 3 years.     This summary is about childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, and MDS.

                    AML or MDS may occur after treatment with certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy.
                    Cancer treatment with certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy may cause therapy -related AML (t-AML) or therapy-related MDS (t-MDS). The risk of these therapy-related myeloid diseases depends on the total dose of the anticancer drugs used and the radiation dose and treatment field. Some patients also have an inherited risk for t-AML and t-MDS. These therapy-related diseases usually occur within 7 years after treatment, but are rare in children.","Factors that contribute to the risk of developing therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) following prior cancer treatment include:

1. **Types of Previous Treatment**: The use of certain anticancer drugs and/or radiation therapy can lead to the development of t-AML or t-MDS.

2. **Cumulative Treatment Dosage**: The risk is influenced by the total dose of the anticancer drugs used as well as the radiation dose and treatment field.

3. **Inherited Risk**: Some patients may have an inherited predisposition that increases their risk for developing t-AML and t-MDS.

4. **Time Frame**: These therapy-related diseases typically occur within 7 years after treatment, although they are rare in children.",510,What factors contribute to the risk of developing therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) following prior cancer treatment?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the factors contributing to the risk of developing therapy-related acute myeloid leukemia (t-AML) or myelodysplastic syndromes (t-MDS) as stated in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers.
                         Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery. If doctors think there might be a brain tumor, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.    The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.         
                    					Some childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed by imaging tests. Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.","A neurological exam assesses the functionality of the brain and spinal cord in a child suspected of having a tumor through a series of questions and tests designed to evaluate various aspects of the nervous system.

They serve as research studies aimed at improving current treatments and discovering new therapies. When clinical trials demonstrate that a new treatment is more effective than the standard approach, it has the potential to become a new standard treatment.

Given the rarity of pediatric cancers like childhood ependymoma, participation in clinical trials is particularly valuable. For patients, involvement in these trials can be the best treatment option available. Clinical trials may allow patients to access novel treatments that are not otherwise available, contributing significantly to their care.

Moreover, these trials contribute to research that enhances the overall understanding and management of childhood cancers. The data collected can reveal important information regarding the safety and efficacy of treatments, ultimately aiding in the development of better therapeutic strategies. Even when trials do not yield successful new treatments, they often provide valuable insights that propel further research and innovation in cancer care.

Patients can enroll in clinical trials at various stages of their treatment, whether before, during, or after starting conventional treatment.

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the stage and grade of the tumor.   The treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage and grade of the tumor.    -  Where the tumor is.    - Whether the patient's other kidney is healthy.    - Whether the cancer has recurred.        Most transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter can be cured if found early.,"The stage and grade of a tumor significantly impact the available treatment options for a given type of cancer, including transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter. 

1. **Stage and Treatment**: The treatment options largely depend on the stage of the cancer, which indicates how far the cancer has spread. For transitional cell cancer:
   - **Stage 0**: When abnormal cells are present but have not invaded nearby tissues.
   - **Stage I**: Cancer has spread into the connective tissue.
   - **Stage II**: Cancer has invaded the muscle layer.
   - **Stage III**: Cancer has spread to surrounding tissues or fat.
   - **Stage IV**: Cancer has metastasized to nearby organs or distant parts of the body.

   Each of these stages will dictate different approaches to treatment, from localized therapies (like surgery) for early stages to more extensive therapies (like chemotherapy or radiation) when the cancer is more advanced.

2. **Grade and Treatment**: The grade of the tumor, which assesses how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and their likely growth rate, also determines the aggressiveness of treatment. Generally, higher grade tumors might require more intensive treatments, including possibly aggressive surgical options, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy, aimed at managing more rapidly growing or poorly differentiated tumors.

Overall, the prognosis and treatment decisions are based on both the stage and grade of the tumor, along with the specific characteristics of the patient's health and the cancer's location.",454,How does the stage and grade of a tumor impact the available treatment options for this type of cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question about how the stage and grade of a tumor impact available treatment options for cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with breast cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with breast cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Most patients with breast cancer have surgery to remove the cancer.     Sentinel lymph node biopsy is the removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node where the cancer is likely to spread. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. After the sentinel lymph node biopsy, the surgeon removes the tumor using breast-conserving surgery or mastectomy. If cancer cells were not found in the sentinel lymph node, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. If cancer cells were found, more lymph nodes will be removed through a separate incision. This is called a lymph node dissection.    Types of surgery include the following:            - Breast-conserving surgery is an operation to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.     -  Total mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer. This procedure is also called a simple mastectomy. Some of the lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked for cancer. This may be done at the same time as the breast surgery or after. This is done through a separate incision.      -  Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles.             Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to remove the tumor. When given before surgery, chemotherapy will shrink the tumor and reduce the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. Treatment given before surgery is called preoperative therapy or neoadjuvant therapy.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, or hormone therapy after surgery, to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called postoperative therapy or adjuvant therapy.     If a patient is going to have a mastectomy, breast reconstruction (surgery to rebuild a breasts shape after a mastectomy) may be considered. Breast reconstruction may be done at the time of the mastectomy or at some time after. The reconstructed breast may be made with the patients own (nonbreast) tissue or by using implants filled with saline or silicone gel. Before the decision to get an implant is made, patients can call the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) Center for Devices and Radiologic Health at 1-888-INFO-FDA (1-888-463-6332) or visit the FDA website for more information on breast implants.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat breast cancer. Internal radiation therapy with strontium-89 (a radionuclide) is used to relieve bone pain caused by breast cancer that has spread to the bones. Strontium-89 is injected into a vein and travels to the surface of the bones. Radiation is released and kills cancer cells in the bones.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Systemic chemotherapy is used in the treatment of breast cancer.    See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. The hormone estrogen, which makes some breast cancers grow, is made mainly by the ovaries. Treatment to stop the ovaries from making estrogen is called ovarian ablation.     Hormone therapy with tamoxifen is often given to patients with early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery and those with metastatic breast cancer (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body). Hormone therapy with tamoxifen or estrogens can act on cells all over the body and may increase the chance of developing endometrial cancer. Women taking tamoxifen should have a pelvic exam every year to look for any signs of cancer. Any vaginal bleeding, other than menstrual bleeding, should be reported to a doctor as soon as possible.    Hormone therapy with a luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone (LHRH) agonist is given to some premenopausal women who have just been diagnosed with hormone receptor positive breast cancer. LHRH agonists decrease the body's estrogen and progesterone.     Hormone therapy with an aromatase inhibitor is given to some postmenopausal women who have hormone receptor positive breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors decrease the body's estrogen by blocking an enzyme called aromatase from turning androgen into estrogen. Anastrozole, letrozole, and exemestane are types of aromatase inhibitors.    For the treatment of early localized breast cancer that can be removed by surgery, certain aromatase inhibitors may be used as adjuvant therapy instead of tamoxifen or after 2 to 3 years of tamoxifen use. For the treatment of metastatic breast cancer, aromatase inhibitors are being tested in clinical trials to compare them to hormone therapy with tamoxifen.    Other types of hormone therapy include megestrol acetate or anti-estrogen therapy such as fulvestrant.    See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, tyrosine kinase inhibitors, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors, mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors, and PARP inhibitors are types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of breast cancer.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies may be used in combination with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.    Types of monoclonal antibody therapy include the following:            -  Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2, which sends growth signals to breast cancer cells. It may be used with other therapies to treat HER2 positive breast cancer.      -  Pertuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be combined with trastuzumab and chemotherapy to treat breast cancer. It may be used to treat certain patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has metastasized (spread to other parts of the body). It may also be used as neoadjuvant therapy in certain patients with early stage HER2 positive breast cancer.     -  Ado-trastuzumab emtansine is a monoclonal antibody linked to an anticancer drug. This is called an antibody-drug conjugate. It is used to treat HER2 positive breast cancer that has spread to other parts of the body or recurred (come back).            Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors include the following:            -  Lapatinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor that blocks the effects of the HER2 protein and other proteins inside tumor cells. It may be used with other drugs to treat patients with HER2 positive breast cancer that has progressed after treatment with trastuzumab.           Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block proteins called cyclin-dependent kinases, which cause the growth of cancer cells. Cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitors include the following:            -  Palbociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used with the drug letrozole to treat breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and HER2 negative and has spread to other parts of the body. It is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy. Palbociclib may also be used with fulvestrant in women whose disease has gotten worse after treatment with hormone therapy.      -  Ribociclib is a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor used with letrozole to treat breast cancer that is hormone receptor positive and HER2 negative and has come back or spread to other parts of the body. It is used in postmenopausal women whose cancer has not been treated with hormone therapy.            Mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. mTOR inhibitors include the following:            -  Everolimus is an mTOR inhibitor used in postmenopausal women with advanced hormone receptor positive breast cancer that is also HER2 negative and has not gotten better with other treatment.            PARP inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. PARP inhibitor therapy is being studied for the treatment of patients with triple negative breast cancer or tumors with  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  mutations.    See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.    Studies have shown that high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not work better than standard chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer. Doctors have decided that, for now, high-dose chemotherapy should be tested only in clinical trials. Before taking part in such a trial, women should talk with their doctors about the serious side effects, including death, that may be caused by high-dose chemotherapy.
                
                
                    Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Some treatments for breast cancer may cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended. These are called late effects.   Late effects of radiation therapy are not common, but may include:         -  Inflammation of the lung after radiation therapy to the breast, especially when chemotherapy is given at the same time.     - Arm lymphedema, especially when radiation therapy is given after lymph node dissection.     - In women younger than 45 years who receive radiation therapy to the chest wall after mastectomy, there may be a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.        Late effects of chemotherapy depend on the drugs used, but may include:         -  Heart failure.    -  Blood clots.    -  Premature menopause.    -  Second cancer, such as leukemia.        Late effects of targeted therapy with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab may include:         - Heart problems such as heart failure.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

		                    Early, Localized, or Operable Breast Cancer
		                    Treatment of early, localized, or operable breast cancer may include the following:       Surgery             -  Breast-conserving surgery and sentinel lymph node biopsy. If cancer is found in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection may be done.     -  Modified radical mastectomy. Breast reconstruction surgery may also be done.                Postoperative radiation therapy     For women who had breast-conserving surgery, radiation therapy is given to the whole breast to lessen the chance the cancer will come back. Radiation therapy may also be given to lymph nodes in the area.    For women who had a modified radical mastectomy, radiation therapy may be given to lessen the chance the cancer will come back if any of the following are true:            - Cancer was found in 4 or more lymph nodes.     - Cancer had spread to tissue around the lymph nodes.     - The tumor was large.     - There is tumor close to or remaining in the tissue near the edges of where the tumor was removed.                Postoperative systemic therapy      Systemic therapy is the use of drugs that can enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body. Postoperative systemic therapy is given to lessen the chance the cancer will come back after surgery to remove the tumor.    Postoperative systemic therapy is given depending on whether:            - The tumor is hormone receptor negative or positive.     - The tumor is HER2/neu negative or positive.     - The tumor is hormone receptor negative and HER2/neu negative (triple negative).     - The size of the tumor.           In premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors, no more treatment may be needed or postoperative therapy may include:            -  Tamoxifen therapy with or without chemotherapy.     - Tamoxifen therapy and treatment to stop or lessen how much estrogen is made by the ovaries. Drug therapy, surgery to remove the ovaries, or radiation therapy to the ovaries may be used.     -  Aromatase inhibitor therapy and treatment to stop or lessen how much estrogen is made by the ovaries. Drug therapy, surgery to remove the ovaries, or radiation therapy to the ovaries may be used.           In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors, no more treatment may be needed or postoperative therapy may include:            - Aromatase inhibitor therapy with or without chemotherapy.     - Tamoxifen followed by aromatase inhibitor therapy, with or without chemotherapy.           In women with hormone receptor negative tumors, no more treatment may be needed or postoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy.           In women with HER2/neu negative tumors, postoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy.           In women with small, HER2/neu positive tumors, and no cancer in the lymph nodes, no more treatment may be needed. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, or the tumor is large, postoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy and targeted therapy (trastuzumab).     -  Hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor therapy, for tumors that are also hormone receptor positive.           In women with small, hormone receptor negative and HER2/neu negative tumors (triple negative) and no cancer in the lymph nodes, no more treatment may be needed. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes or the tumor is large, postoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy.     - Radiation therapy.     - A clinical trial of a new chemotherapy regimen.     - A clinical trial of PARP inhibitor therapy.                Preoperative systemic therapy     Systemic therapy is the use of drugs that can enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body. Preoperative systemic therapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery.    In postmenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors, preoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy.     - Hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor therapy, for women who cannot have chemotherapy.           In premenopausal women with hormone receptor positive tumors, preoperative therapy may include:            - A clinical trial of hormone therapy, such as tamoxifen or aromatase inhibitor therapy.           In women with HER2/neu positive tumors, preoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy and targeted therapy (trastuzumab).     - Targeted therapy (pertuzumab).           In women with HER2/neu negative tumors or triple negative tumors, preoperative therapy may include:            - Chemotherapy.

During the procedure, a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor, which flows through the lymphatic system to the sentinel lymph node. This node is then removed and examined by a pathologist for cancer cells. If no cancer cells are found, it may not be necessary to remove additional lymph nodes, potentially reducing the extent of surgery and associated complications. This information helps determine the stage of the cancer and informs subsequent treatment decisions.",695,How does a sentinel lymph node biopsy contribute to the surgical treatment of breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of a sentinel lymph node biopsy in the surgical treatment of breast cancer, mirroring the detailed context and process outlined in the original answer about the procedure.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The type of germ cell tumor.    - Where the tumor first began to grow.    - The stage of the cancer (whether it has spread to nearby areas or to other places in the body).    - How well the tumor responds to treatment (lower AFP and -hCG levels).    - Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        The prognosis for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, especially ovarian germ cell tumors, is good.","When determining treatment options for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, the following specific factors are considered:

1. **Type of germ cell tumor**: The classification of the tumor (e.g., mature teratoma, immature teratoma, malignant germ cell tumor) affects treatment decisions.

2. **Location of the tumor**: Treatment may vary depending on whether the tumor is gonadal (in the ovaries or testicles) or extragonadal (located elsewhere in the body).

3. **Stage of cancer**: The extent to which cancer has spread, including whether it is localized or has metastasized to other areas, plays a crucial role in selecting appropriate therapies.

4. **Response to treatment**: How well the tumor responds to initial treatment (e.g., indicated by levels of tumor markers like AFP and -hCG) will influence subsequent treatment plans.

5. **Surgical operability**: The ability to completely remove the tumor through surgery can significantly impact treatment options, including whether adjuvant therapies (like chemotherapy) are needed post-surgery.

6. **Patient's age and overall health**: The individual characteristics and overall health status of the child can influence treatment decisions and approaches.

7. **Recurrence status**: Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred affects the treatment strategy moving forward. 

These factors together shape the individualized treatment plan for children with extracranial germ cell tumors.",108,What specific factors are considered when determining the treatment options for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding the specific factors considered when determining the treatment options for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors.

"Having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor.    Risk factors for bile duct cancer include the following conditions:         - Primary sclerosing cholangitis (a progressive disease in which the bile ducts become blocked by inflammation and scarring).    -  Chronic ulcerative colitis.    -  Cysts in the bile ducts (cysts block the flow of bile and can cause swollen bile ducts, inflammation, and infection).    - Infection with a Chinese liver fluke parasite.","Yes, there is a connection between chronic ulcerative colitis and bile duct cancer. Chronic ulcerative colitis is listed as a risk factor for developing bile duct cancer, indicating that individuals with this condition may have an increased likelihood of developing the disease. The exact mechanism linking chronic ulcerative colitis to bile duct cancer is not detailed in the context provided. However, it is known that conditions causing prolonged inflammation in the gastrointestinal tract can lead to an elevated risk of various cancers, including bile duct cancer.

                    - Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.    - Signs and symptoms of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary include a lump or pain in the neck or throat.     - Tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract, and upper part of the digestive tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose metastatic squamous neck cancer and the primary tumor.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
                    Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and the lining of body cavities such as the mouth, hollow organs such as the uterus and blood vessels, and the lining of the respiratory (breathing) and digestive tracts. Some organs with squamous cells are the esophagus, lungs, kidneys, and uterus. Cancer can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the body and metastasize (spread) through the blood or lymph system to other parts of the body.    When squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck or around the collarbone, it is called metastatic squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the primary tumor (the cancer that first formed in the body), because treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the primary tumor. For example, when lung cancer spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow. When tests cannot find a primary tumor, it is called an occult (hidden) primary tumor. In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.","The prognosis and treatment options for patients diagnosed with metastatic squamous neck cancer with an undetected primary tumor are influenced by several key factors:

1. **Number and Size of Involved Lymph Nodes**: The extent of involvement can affect the prognosis and treatment choices.
  
2. **Response to Treatment**: If the cancer has responded well to initial treatments or if it has recurred will influence management strategies.

3. **Appearance of Cancer Cells**: How different the cancer cells look compared to normal cells under a microscope can provide insights into aggressiveness and potential outcomes.

4. **Patient's Age and General Health**: These factors are crucial as they can impact the patient's ability to tolerate various treatment options and their overall resilience during treatment.

5. **Anatomical Location**: Treatment options may vary depending on which specific area of the neck is affected.

6. **Tumor Markers**: The presence of certain tumor markers can influence the prognosis as well as treatment decisions.

Together, these factors collectively shape the management plan and outlook for patients with this condition.",270,What factors influence the prognosis and treatment options for patients diagnosed with metastatic squamous neck cancer with an undetected primary tumor?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the prognosis and treatment options for patients diagnosed with metastatic squamous neck cancer with an undetected primary tumor, which directly relates to the original answer.

They are described as:         - Standard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/L at the time of diagnosis.    - High risk: Includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/L or more at the time of diagnosis.    - Very high risk: Includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the genes, children who have a slow response to initial treatment, and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment.        Other factors that affect the risk group include the following:         - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes.    - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment.    - Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis.        It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment. Children with high-risk or very highrisk ALL usually receive more anticancer drugs and/or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.
                
                
                
                    Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated.
                    The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, spinal cord, testicles, or other parts of the body.    Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment.","The different risk groups for childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) significantly influence the treatment plan for affected children. There are three risk groups: 

1. **Standard (low) risk**: Children aged 1 to younger than 10 years with a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/L at diagnosis typically receive a standard course of treatment, which involves less intensive therapy.

2. **High risk**: This group includes children 10 years and older, or those with a white blood cell count of 50,000/L or more at diagnosis. They require more aggressive treatment, which consists of higher doses of anticancer drugs and may involve more frequent administration of chemotherapy.

3. **Very high risk**: This category includes children younger than age 1, those with specific gene changes, those who show a slow response to initial treatment, or have signs of leukemia after four weeks of treatment. Children in this group usually receive even more intensive therapy than the high-risk group, often including additional anticancer drugs.

The treatment plans are tailored based on these risk categorizations to optimize the effectiveness of the treatment while considering the potential side effects and long-term impacts on the child's health. For instance, children with high-risk or very high-risk ALL usually receive more anticancer drugs and/or higher doses compared to those classified as standard-risk. Additionally, treatment may also involve specialized therapy approaches depending on the biological features of the leukemia cells and the child's overall response to initial treatments.",556,How do the different risk groups for childhood ALL influence the treatment plan for affected children?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and elaborates on the key points from the original answer regarding the different risk groups for childhood ALL and their influence on treatment plans. It clearly identifies the three risk groups, explains the characteristics of each group, and discusses their impact on treatment, which directly addresses the generated question."
"Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer.    Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:            -  Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.      -  Being exposed to secondhand smoke.     - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following:                  -  Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.       -  Radon in the home or workplace.       -  Imaging tests such as CT scans.       - Atomic bomb radiation.                 -  Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace.     -  Living where there is air pollution.     -  Having a family history of lung cancer.     -  Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).     -  Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.     When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.","Yes, being diagnosed with HIV can influence a person's risk for lung cancer. Individuals infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of developing lung cancer compared to those who are not infected. However, it's important to note that since smoking rates are higher in individuals with HIV, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is solely due to HIV infection or if it is also significantly influenced by exposure to cigarette smoke.",37,"Can being diagnosed with HIV influence a person's risk for lung cancer, and if so, in what way?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the influence of HIV on lung cancer risk, which is mentioned in the original answer as a risk factor. It provides specific information about the increased risk associated with HIV and acknowledges the potential confounding factor of smoking, maintaining relevance to the content of the original answer."

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood astrocytoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with astrocytomas. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with astrocytomas should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain tumors.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Pediatric neurosurgeon.     -  Neurologist.    -  Neuropathologist.     -  Neuroradiologist.     -  Rehabilitation specialist.     -  Radiation oncologist.     -  Endocrinologist.     -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.     - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.     -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).         Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Six types of treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is used to diagnose and treat childhood astrocytoma, as discussed in the General Information section of this summary. If cancer cells remain after surgery, further treatment depends on:             - Where the remaining cancer cells are.     - The grade of the tumor.     - The age of the child.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that remain. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be used:            - If the patient has no symptoms, such as patients with neurofibromatosis type1.     - If the tumor is small and is found when a different health problem is being diagnosed or treated.     - After the tumor is removed by surgery until signs or symptoms appear or change.              Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       -  Stereotactic radiation therapy: Stereotactic radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims radiation directly at the tumor. The total dose of radiation is divided into several smaller doses given over several days. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood astrocytomas.     Radiation therapy to the brain can affect growth and development, especially in young children. For children younger than 3 years, chemotherapy may be given instead, to delay or reduce the need for radiation therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of tumor and where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. Systemic combination chemotherapy is used in the treatment of children with astrocytoma. High-dose chemotherapy may be used in the treatment of children with newly diagnosed high-grade astrocytoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    For high-grade astrocytoma that has come back after treatment, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is used if there is only a small amount of tumor.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.    There are different types of targeted therapy:            -  Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell, to stop cancer cells. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion into a vein. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. There are different types of monoclonal antibody therapy:                  -  Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) inhibitor therapy: Cancer cells make a substance called VEGF, which causes new blood vessels to form (angiogenesis) and helps the cancer grow. VEGF inhibitors block VEGF and stop new blood vessels from forming. This may kill cancer cells because they need new blood vessels to grow. Bevacizumab is a VEGF inhibitor and angiogenesis inhibitor being used to treat childhood astrocytoma.       -  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. PD-1 inhibitors are being studied to treat high-grade astrocytoma that has recurred.                -  Protein kinase inhibitors work in different ways. There are several kinds of protein kinase inhibitors.                  -  mTOR inhibitors stop cells from dividing and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and sirolimus are mTOR inhibitors used to treat childhood subependymal giant cell astrocytomas. mTOR inhibitors also are being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred.       -  BRAF inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. The BRAF inhibitor dabrafenib is being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib have been used to treat high-grade astrocytomas that have recurred but more study is needed to know how well they work in children.       - MEK inhibitors block proteins needed for cell growth and may kill cancer cells. MEK inhibitors such as selumetinib are being studied to treat low-grade astrocytoma that has recurred.                       See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Other drug therapy     Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow.
                
                
                    If fluid builds up around the brain and spinal cord, a cerebrospinal fluid diversion procedure may be done.
                    Cerebrospinal fluid diversion is a method used to drain fluid that has built up around the brain and spinal cord. A shunt (long, thin tube) is placed in a ventricle (fluid-filled space) of the brain and threaded under the skin to another part of the body, usually the abdomen. The shunt carries extra fluid away from the brain so it may be absorbed elsewhere in the body.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. (See the General Information section for a list of tests.) Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Regular MRIs will continue to be done after treatment has ended. The results of the MRI can show if your child's condition has changed or if the astrocytoma has recurred (come back). If the results of the MRI show a mass in the brain, a biopsy may be done to find out if it is made up of dead tumor cells or if new cancer cells are growing.

							                    Newly Diagnosed Childhood Low-Grade Astrocytomas
							                    When the tumor is first diagnosed, treatment for childhood low-grade astrocytoma depends on where the tumor is, and is usually surgery. An MRI is done after surgery to see if there is tumor remaining.    If the tumor was completely removed by surgery, more treatment may not be needed and the child is closely watched to see if signs or symptoms appear or change. This is called observation.    If there is tumor remaining after surgery, treatment may include the following:         - Observation.    - A second surgery to remove the tumor.    -  Radiation therapy, which may include conformal radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy, proton beam radiation therapy, or stereotactic radiation therapy, when the tumor begins to grow again.    -  Combination chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy.        In some cases, observation is used for children who have a visual pathway glioma. In other cases, treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy. A goal of treatment is to save as much vision as possible. The effect of tumor growth on the child's vision will be closely followed during treatment.    Children with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) may not need treatment unless the tumor grows or signs or symptoms, such as vision problems, appear. When the tumor grows or signs or symptoms appear, treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and/or chemotherapy.   Children with tuberous sclerosis may develop benign (not cancer) tumors in the brain called subependymal giant cell astrocytomas (SEGAs). Targeted therapy with everolimus or sirolimus may be used instead of surgery, to shrink the tumors.

Before more cancer treatment is given, imaging tests, biopsy, or surgery are done to find out if there is cancer and how much there is.   Treatment of recurrent childhood low-grade astrocytoma may include the following:         - A second surgery to remove the tumor, if surgery was the only treatment given when the tumor was first diagnosed.    -  Radiation therapy to the tumor only, if radiation therapy was not used when the tumor was first diagnosed. Conformal radiation therapy may be given.    -  Chemotherapy, if the tumor recurred where it cannot be removed by surgery or the patient had radiation therapy when the tumor was first diagnosed.    -  Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (bevacizumab) with or without chemotherapy.    - A clinical trial of targeted therapy with a BRAF inhibitor (dabrafenib), an mTOR inhibitor (everolimus), or a MEK inhibitor (selumetinib).    - A clinical trial of lenalidomide.

Clinical trials are conducted to determine if new treatments are safe and effective or better than existing standard treatments. By participating, a child may receive either the standard treatment or be among the first to access a new treatment that could be more effective. Additionally, participants in clinical trials contribute to advancing cancer research, which can lead to improvements in treatment for future patients. Even if a trial doesn't result in effective new treatments, it can still provide valuable information that helps move research forward.

Factors that might qualify a child for participation in these trials include:

1. **Timing of Treatment**: Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. Some trials may only include patients who have not yet received treatment, whereas others may focus on those whose cancer has not improved.
   
2. **Type of Treatment Tested**: Trials may be designed for various scenarios, including testing new treatments for patients whose cancer has recurred or investigating methods to reduce side effects of existing treatments.

Overall, discussions with the child's doctor can provide guidance on which clinical trials may be appropriate based on the child’s specific condition and treatment history.",285,"How can participation in a clinical trial potentially benefit a child suffering from childhood astrocytoma, and what are some factors that might qualify them for these trials?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the benefits of participation in clinical trials for children with childhood astrocytoma, aligning well with the original answer's points on the importance of clinical trials.

                    Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.
                    The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. It lies just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland makes fluid that is part of the semen.      Prostate cancer is most common in older men. In the U.S., about 1 out of 5 men will be diagnosed with prostate cancer.","The prostate gland plays a vital role in the male reproductive system by producing fluid that is a component of semen. It is located just below the bladder and surrounds part of the urethra, which is the tube that carries urine from the bladder. As men age, the prostate may enlarge, which can lead to urinary problems due to its proximity to the urethra.

Prostate cancer affects the function of the prostate gland by the formation of malignant cells within its tissues. This cancer can disrupt normal prostate function and lead to symptoms such as a weak flow of urine, frequent urination, and difficulties in emptying the bladder completely. Moreover, as the cancer progresses, it may further invade surrounding tissues, potentially leading to more severe urinary issues and affecting sexual function. In summary, the development of prostate cancer impairs the prostate's ability to perform its functions effectively.",96,Can you explain the role of the prostate gland in the male reproductive system and how prostate cancer affects its function?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of the prostate gland and how prostate cancer impacts its function.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis:            -  Mohs micrographic surgery: The tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove skin cancer on the face.      - Simple excision: The tumor is cut from the skin along with some of the normal skin around it.      - Shave excision: The abnormal area is shaved off the surface of the skin with a small blade.      -  Electrodesiccation and curettage: The tumor is cut from the skin with a curette (a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). A needle-shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound. The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer.     -  Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as carcinoma in situ. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.     -  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor.     -  Dermabrasion: Removal of the top layer of skin using a rotating wheel or small particles to rub away skin cells.              Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat skin cancer.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Chemotherapy for nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis is usually topical (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the condition being treated.     Retinoids (drugs related to vitamin A) are sometimes used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.    See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.       Photodynamic therapy     Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue.       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Interferon and imiquimod are biologic agents used to treat skin cancer. Interferon (by injection) may be used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Topical imiquimod therapy (a cream applied to the skin) may be used to treat some small basal cell carcinomas.    See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.     Targeted therapy with a signal transduction inhibitor is used to treat basal cell carcinoma. Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Vismodegib and sonidegib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat basal cell carcinoma.     See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are likely to recur (come back), usually within 5 years, or new tumors may form. Talk to your doctor about how often you should have your skin checked for signs of cancer.

In PDT, a light-sensitive drug is injected into a vein, where it preferentially accumulates in cancer cells. When laser light is then aimed at the skin, it activates the drug, leading to the destruction of the cancer cells while causing minimal damage to healthy tissue.

The advantages of photodynamic therapy compared to traditional treatments like chemotherapy include:

1. **Targeted Treatment**: PDT specifically targets cancer cells, which reduces damage to surrounding healthy tissue.
2. **Minimal Side Effects**: Photodynamic therapy generally causes fewer side effects than chemotherapy, which can affect systemic health because it impacts not just cancer cells but also other rapidly dividing normal cells in the body.
3. **Less Invasive**: PDT is less invasive than surgical options and does not require general anesthesia or extensive recovery time.
4. **Cosmetic Outcomes**: There may be better cosmetic outcomes with PDT as it tends to preserve more healthy skin compared to more invasive treatments.

Overall, while traditional treatments like chemotherapy and surgery are effective, PDT offers a different approach that may be easier on patients, particularly for certain types of nonmelanoma skin cancers.",117,"How does photodynamic therapy work for skin cancer, and what are its advantages compared to traditional treatments like chemotherapy?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes how photodynamic therapy works for skin cancer and outlines its advantages over traditional treatments like chemotherapy.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.
                    Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:
                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.","Some of the risk factors associated with developing nonmelanoma skin cancer include:

- Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (like from tanning beds) over long periods.
- Having a fair complexion, which includes fair skin that freckles and burns easily, blue or green or other light-colored eyes, and red or blond hair.

                    After transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the renal pelvis and ureter or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the renal pelvis and ureter or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Ureteroscopy : A procedure to look inside the ureter and renal pelvis to check for abnormal areas. A ureteroscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. The ureteroscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder, ureter, and renal pelvis. A tool may be inserted through the ureteroscope to take tissue samples to be checked under a microscope for signs of disease.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if transitional cell cancer of the ureter spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually ureter cancer cells. The disease is metastatic cancer of the ureter, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and/or ureter:
                    Stage 0 (Papillary Carcinoma and Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in tissue lining the inside of the renal pelvis or ureter. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is divided into stage 0a and stage 0is, depending on the type of tumor:             -  Stage 0a may look like tiny mushrooms growing from the tissue lining the inside of the renal pelvis or ureter. Stage 0a is also called noninvasive papillary carcinoma.     -  Stage 0is is a flat tumor on the tissue lining the inside of the renal pelvis or ureter. Stage 0is is also called carcinoma in situ.              Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and spread through the lining of the renal pelvis and/or ureter, into the layer of connective tissue.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread through the layer of connective tissue to the muscle layer of the renal pelvis and/or ureter.       Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread:            - From the renal pelvis to tissue or fat in the kidney; or     - From the ureter to fat that surrounds the ureter.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread to at least one of the following:            - A nearby organ.     - The layer of fat surrounding the kidney.     - One or more lymph nodes.     - Distant parts of the body, such as the lung, liver, or bone.
                
                
                    Transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter is also described as localized, regional, or metastatic:
                    Localized    The cancer is found only in the kidney.       Regional    The cancer has spread to tissues around the kidney and to nearby lymph nodes and blood vessels in the pelvis.       Metastatic    The cancer has spread to other parts of the body.","The process of metastasis in transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter involves the cancer spreading from its original location to distant organs. This can occur through three primary pathways:

1. **Tissue**: The cancer cells can invade nearby tissues, growing from the original tumor into surrounding areas.

2. **Lymph System**: Cancer cells can enter the lymphatic system. Once inside, they can travel through lymph vessels to reach other bodies, where they may form metastatic tumors (tumors that originated from the primary cancer).

3. **Blood**: Cancer cells can also enter the bloodstream. They travel through blood vessels to other parts of the body, leading to metastasis in distant organs such as the lungs, liver, or bones.

When transitional cell cancer spreads, it retains the characteristics of the original cancer. For instance, if cells from the ureter spread to the lung, the cells in the lung are still considered ureter cancer cells, not lung cancer. This spreading process is formally referred to as metastasis. Current staging methodologies help determine the stage of the disease and inform treatment planning based on whether the cancer is localized, regional, or metastatic.",455,"How does the process of metastasis work in transitional cell cancer, particularly the pathways through which cancer cells can spread to distant organs such as the lungs or liver?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the process of metastasis in transitional cell cancer, outlining the key pathways (tissue, lymph system, and blood) through which cancer cells can spread.

"Tests that examine the rectum and colon are used to detect (find) and diagnose rectal cancer. Tests used to diagnose rectal cancer include the following:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual. In women, the vagina may also be examined.    -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue), abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Tumor tissue that is removed during the biopsy may be checked to see if the patient is likely to have the gene mutation that causes HNPCC. This may help to plan treatment. The following tests may be used:               -  Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes.      -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.             -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay : A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of rectal cancer or other conditions.","A physical exam can reveal specific signs of rectal cancer such as lumps or unusual growths in the rectal area. The digital rectal exam (DRE) is specifically designed to feel for any irregularities in the rectum. This type of examination, combined with a patient's health history, allows the doctor to check for general signs of disease, which may indicate the presence of rectal cancer.",227,What specific signs of disease can a physical exam reveal when diagnosing rectal cancer?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the specific signs that a physical exam can reveal when diagnosing rectal cancer, such as lumps or unusual growths.

                    Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
                    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs work in the body).   The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.   The peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.
                
                
                    Ovarian cancer is the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system.
                    In recent years, there has been a small decrease in the number of new cases of ovarian cancer and the number of deaths from ovarian cancer. New cases of ovarian cancer and deaths from ovarian cancer are higher among white women than black women, but have decreased in both groups.   Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer and/or certain inherited gene changes, such as BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene changes, have a higher risk than women who do not have a family history or who have not inherited these gene changes. For women with inherited risk, genetic counseling and genetic testing can be used to find out more about how likely they are to develop ovarian cancer.   It is hard to find ovarian cancer early. Early ovarian cancer may not cause any symptoms. When symptoms do appear, ovarian cancer is often advanced.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:         -  Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers (written for health professionals)    -  Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Screening     -  Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment","Genetic counseling and testing can help women with a family history of ovarian cancer assess their risk by:

1. **Identifying Inherited Risks**: Women who have certain inherited gene mutations, such as BRCA1 and BRCA2 changes, have an increased risk of developing ovarian cancer. Genetic testing can determine if a woman carries these mutations.

2. **Evaluating Family History**: A family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer increases the risk. Genetic counseling can help interpret family history and identify women who may be at higher risk due to their genetic background.

3. **Providing Risk Reduction Options**: For those identified as having a significant hereditary risk, genetic counseling can outline options for risk-reducing strategies, such as preventative surgeries (e.g., risk-reducing salpingo-oophorectomy) and lifestyle modifications aimed at lowering the risk of cancer.

4. **Facilitating Informed Decision Making**: Through counseling, women can make informed decisions about their health management options, including whether to undergo genetic testing, screening protocols, and preventative measures based on their individualized risk assessment. 

In summary, genetic counseling and testing provide critical insights that empower women with a family history of ovarian cancer to understand and manage their cancer risk effectively.",286,In what ways can genetic counseling and testing help women with a family history of ovarian cancer assess their risk?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of genetic counseling and testing for women with a family history of ovarian cancer, which aligns with the original answer's mention of genetic risks and the role of counseling in evaluating that risk.

"Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.
	                    	Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.   For information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see the Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention summary.   Talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer.
	                	
                		
		                    Screening tests have risks.
		                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to talk about the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
		                
		                
		                    The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening tests include the following:
		                    Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may not improve health or help a woman live longer.    Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have advanced ovarian cancer or if it has already spread to other places in your body.        False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is present. A woman who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if she has symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.     Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests (such as a laparoscopy or a laparotomy to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to diagnose ovarian cancer include infection, blood loss, bowel injury, and heart and blood vessel problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries).","The specific factors that can increase the likelihood of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer include:

1. **Family History**: Women with a family history of ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer, especially a mother or sister affected by it, have a higher risk. Multiple relatives with ovarian cancer further increase the risk.

2. **Inherited Genetic Changes**: Certain inherited gene mutations, particularly in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, significantly elevate the risk of ovarian cancer. Other inherited syndromes, such as familial site-specific ovarian cancer syndrome, familial breast/ovarian cancer syndrome, and hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer (Lynch syndrome), are also associated with increased risk.

3. **Hormone Replacement Therapy (HRT)**: The use of estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy after menopause is linked to a slightly increased risk of ovarian cancer, especially with prolonged use.

4. **Weight and Height**: Being overweight or obese during teenage years is associated with a higher risk. Additionally, being tall (5'8"" or taller) may also slightly increase risk.

These factors can contribute to an overall increased likelihood of developing these cancers.",239,"What specific factors can increase the likelihood of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about specific factors that can increase the likelihood of developing ovarian, fallopian tube, or primary peritoneal cancer.

                    After retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the eye or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines whether retinoblastoma is only in the eye (intraocular) or has spread outside the eye (extraocular). It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner that also takes a picture of the body. Areas of bone with cancer show up brighter in the picture because they take up more radioactive material than normal bone cells do.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
                
                
                    The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.
                    There are several staging systems for retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread.      Stage 0     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without surgery.        Stage I    The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer cells remain.        Stage II     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and there are cancer cells left that can be seen only with a microscope.        Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIa and IIIb:            - In stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to tissues around the eye socket.     - In stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to lymph nodes near the ear or in the neck.               Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stages IVa and IVb:            - In stage IVa, cancer has spread to the blood but not to the brain or spinal cord. One or more tumors may have spread to other parts of the body such as the bone or liver.     - In stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).
                    Intraocular retinoblastoma     In intraocular retinoblastoma, cancer is found in one or both eyes and may be in the retina only or may also be in other parts of the eye such as the choroid, ciliary body, or part of the optic nerve. Cancer has not spread to tissues around the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body.        Extraocular retinoblastoma (metastatic)    In extraocular retinoblastoma, cancer has spread beyond the eye. It may be found in tissues around the eye (orbital retinoblastoma) or it may have spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the liver, bones, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.","Intraocular retinoblastoma refers to cancer that is confined within one or both eyes, affecting the retina and possibly extending to surrounding ocular structures like the choroid and optic nerve. In this stage, the cancer has not spread to nearby tissues outside the eye or to other parts of the body. The treatment options are typically less aggressive and may include systemic chemotherapy, ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy, cryotherapy, thermotherapy, and possibly surgery (enucleation) if vision cannot be preserved.

In contrast, extraocular retinoblastoma indicates that the cancer has metastasized beyond the eye, potentially affecting surrounding tissues (such as the orbit) or distant sites like the central nervous system, liver, or bones. This stage typically requires a more intensive treatment approach, which may include systemic chemotherapy, radiation therapy (external-beam or intrathecal), and surgery depending on the extent of spread.

The implications for treatment are significant; intraocular retinoblastoma may allow for more vision-sparing approaches, while extraocular retinoblastoma demands comprehensive systemic treatment strategies due to the increased risk of disease spread and complications. Therefore, the staging of the condition is crucial for determining the appropriate treatment protocol.",651,Can you explain the differences between intraocular and extraocular retinoblastoma and their implications for treatment?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the differences between intraocular and extraocular retinoblastoma, including their definitions, implications for treatment, and treatment approaches. It aligns well with the key points presented in the original answer, demonstrating a clear relationship in content and context."
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The type of ovarian cancer and how much cancer there is.    - The stage and grade of the cancer.    - Whether the patient has extra fluid in the abdomen that causes swelling.    - Whether all of the tumor can be removed by surgery.    - Whether there are changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes.    - The patients age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).,"A patient's age and overall health status significantly impact their recovery chances from ovarian epithelial cancer. These factors influence treatment options and prognosis, which are critical for determining the likelihood of successful recovery. Generally, younger patients and those in better health are more likely to tolerate aggressive treatments like surgery and chemotherapy, which can enhance their recovery chances. Conversely, older patients or those with compromised health may face additional challenges, including reduced ability to undergo surgery or manage the side effects of chemotherapy, which can adversely affect their prognosis. Additionally, the presence of other health conditions can complicate treatment and recovery, further affecting outcomes.",491,How might a patient's age and overall health status alter or determine their recovery chances from ovarian epithelial cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the role of a patient's age and overall health status in determining their recovery chances from ovarian cancer, which is a key aspect mentioned in the original answer.

"A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer.
                    Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for breast cancer.    Risk factors for breast cancer include the following:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.     - A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister).     - Inherited changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes or in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.     - Breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram.     -  Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body. This may be caused by:                  -  Menstruating at an early age.       -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth.       - Starting menopause at a later age.                - Taking hormones such as estrogen combined with progestin for symptoms of menopause.     - Treatment with radiation therapy to the breast/chest.     - Drinking alcohol.     -  Obesity.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.      NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider.

The use of certain medicines and other factors decrease the risk of breast cancer. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.    Protective factors for breast cancer include the following:            - Taking any of the following:                  -  Estrogen-only hormone therapy after a hysterectomy.       -  Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs).        -  Aromatase inhibitors.                - Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with retinoblastoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with retinoblastoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with retinoblastoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    The goals of treatment are to save the child's life, to save vision and the eye, and to prevent serious side effects. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with eye cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric ophthalmologist (children's eye doctor) who has a lot of experience in treating retinoblastoma and the following specialists:         -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatrician.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Geneticist or genetic counselor.

                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of treatment for retinoblastoma may include the following:          - Physical problems such as seeing or hearing problems or, if the eye is removed, a change in the shape and size of the bone around the eye.     - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.     -  Second cancers (new types of cancer), such as lung and bladder cancers, osteosarcoma, soft tissue sarcoma, or melanoma.         The following risk factors may increase the risk of having another cancer:         - Having the heritable form of retinoblastoma.    - Past treatment with radiation therapy, especially before age 1 year.    - Having already had a previous second cancer.        It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. Regular follow-up by health professionals who are experts in diagnosing and treating late effects is important. See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Cryotherapy     Cryotherapy is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryosurgery.       Thermotherapy     Thermotherapy is the use of heat to destroy cancer cells. Thermotherapy may be given using a laser beam aimed through the dilated pupil or onto the outside of the eyeball. Thermotherapy may be used alone for small tumors or combined with chemotherapy for larger tumors. This treatment is a type of laser therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the stage of the cancer and where the cancer is in the body.    There are different types of chemotherapy:            -  Systemic chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body. Systemic chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor (chemoreduction) and avoid surgery to remove the eye. After chemoreduction, other treatments may include radiation therapy, cryotherapy, laser therapy, or regional chemotherapy.  Systemic chemotherapy may also be given to kill any cancer cells that are left after the initial treatment or to patients with retinoblastoma that occurs outside the eye. Treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.     - Regional chemotherapy: When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ (such as the eye), or a body cavity, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas. Several types of regional chemotherapy are used to treat retinoblastoma.                  -  Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy: Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy carries anticancer drugs directly to the eye. A catheter is put into an artery that leads to the eye and the anticancer drug is given through the catheter. After the drug is given, a small balloon may be inserted into the artery to block it and keep most of the anticancer drug trapped near the tumor. This type of chemotherapy may be given as the initial treatment when the tumor is in the eye only or when the tumor has not responded to other types of treatment. Ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy is given at special retinoblastoma treatment centers.        -  Intravitreal chemotherapy: Intravitreal chemotherapy is the injection of anticancer drugs directly into the vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside in the eye. It is used to treat cancer that has spread to the vitreous humor and has not responded to treatment or has come back after treatment.                       See Drugs Approved for Retinoblastoma for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External-beam radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       -  Proton-beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Plaque radiotherapy: Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.                      The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and how the cancer responded to other treatments. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat retinoblastoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    See Drugs Approved for Retinoblastoma for more information.       Surgery (enucleation)      Enucleation is surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. A sample of the eye tissue that is removed will be checked under a microscope to see if there are any signs that the cancer is likely to spread to other parts of the body. This should be done by an experienced pathologist, who is familiar with retinoblastoma and other diseases of the eye. Enucleation is done if there is little or no chance that vision can be saved and when the tumor is large, did not respond to treatment, or comes back after treatment. The patient will be fitted for an artificial eye.    Close follow-up is needed for 2 years or more to check for signs of recurrence in the area around the affected eye and to check the other eye.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

		                    If it is likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:         -  Systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy, with or without intravitreal chemotherapy, to shrink the tumor. This may be followed by one or more of the following:               -  Cryotherapy.       -  Thermotherapy.      -  Plaque radiotherapy.             -  External-beam radiation therapy for bilateral intraocular retinoblastoma that does not respond to other treatments.    - A clinical trial of ophthalmic artery infusion for unilateral retinoblastoma that has spread to the vitreous humor.        If the tumor is large and it is not likely that the eye can be saved, treatment may include the following:         -  Surgery (enucleation). After surgery, systemic chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.        When retinoblastoma is in both eyes, the treatment for each eye may be different, depending on the size of the tumor and whether it is likely that the eye can be saved. The dose of systemic chemotherapy is usually based on the eye that has more cancer.   Treatment for cavitary retinoblastoma, a type of intraocular retinoblastoma, may include the following:         - Systemic chemotherapy or ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy.

### Cryotherapy
- **Definition**: Cryotherapy, also known as cryosurgery, involves using an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, specifically targeting the cancerous part of the retina.
- **Administration**: The procedure typically entails applying extreme cold directly to the tumor. This can be done in a specialized clinical setting where the patient's eye is carefully positioned for precise treatment.
- **Usage**: Cryotherapy is generally used for smaller tumors or as an adjunctive treatment after systemic chemotherapy to manage retinoblastoma and reduce tumor size. It may also be part of a treatment plan when conserving vision is a priority.

### Thermotherapy
- **Definition**: Thermotherapy utilizes heat to destroy cancer cells, often administered via laser therapy. 
- **Administration**: This treatment can be delivered using a laser beam, which is directed either through the dilated pupil or on the outside of the eyeball. The heat generated by the laser targets the tumor effectively while minimizing damage to the surrounding healthy tissue.
- **Usage**: Thermotherapy is suitable for small tumors or can be combined with chemotherapy for larger tumors. It offers a less invasive option aimed at reducing tumor size and is particularly beneficial when the potential for preserving the eye and vision exists.

Both cryotherapy and thermotherapy are pivotal in the management of retinoblastoma, especially when balancing tumor control and the preservation of vision in affected children. These methods would be selected based on the tumor's characteristics, size, location, and the overall treatment strategy devised by a specialized medical team.",652,"Can you describe the different methods used in cryotherapy and thermotherapy for retinoblastoma, including how they are administered and the situations in which they would be used?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes cryotherapy and thermotherapy, including their definitions, administration, and usage, which aligns well with the information provided in the original answer.

                    - Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary or lining the fallopian tube or peritoneum.     - Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue and are treated the same way.    - Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer are at an increased risk of ovarian cancer.    - Some ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are caused by inherited gene mutations (changes).    - Women with an increased risk of ovarian cancer may consider surgery to lessen the risk.    - Signs and symptoms of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer include pain or swelling in the abdomen.    - Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.    - Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).
                
                
                    Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary or lining the fallopian tube or peritoneum.
                    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs work).    The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.   The peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.       Ovarian epithelial cancer is one type of cancer that affects the ovary. See the following PDQ treatment summaries for information about other types of ovarian tumors:         -  Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors     -  Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment (ovarian cancer in children)

                    After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.   The following procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:
                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.             -  Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).     -  Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.              Stage II     In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.        Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.            -  Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.      -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.
                
                
                    Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:
                    Low-risk endometrial cancer     Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.       High-risk endometrial cancer     Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.","Endometrial cancer can metastasize to other parts of the body through three primary mechanisms: tissue invasion, spread through the lymphatic system, and dissemination via the blood. 

1. **Tissue**: The cancer spreads locally by growing into nearby areas.
2. **Lymph system**: Cancer cells may enter the lymphatic system and travel through the lymph vessels to form metastatic tumors in other areas.
3. **Blood**: Cancer can also invade the blood vessels, allowing cells to circulate and establish secondary tumors in distant organs.

The significance of a metastatic tumor lies in the fact that it is composed of the same type of cancer cells as the primary tumor. For instance, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lungs, the cells in the lung are still endometrial cancer cells, not lung cancer cells. This categorization as metastatic endometrial cancer is crucial for treatment and prognosis, as it determines the therapeutic approach needed to manage the disease effectively. Understanding the metastatic process helps in staging the cancer and planning appropriate treatment strategies.",33,"In what ways can endometrial cancer metastasize to other parts of the body, and what is the significance of a metastatic tumor?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the ways endometrial cancer can metastasize, mirroring the original answer's emphasis on tissue invasion, the lymphatic system, and blood dissemination.

                    Salivary gland cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the salivary glands.
                    The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth. Saliva has enzymes that help digest food and antibodies that help protect against infections of the mouth and throat. There are 3 pairs of major salivary glands:         - Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands and are found in front of and just below each ear. Most major salivary gland tumors begin in this gland.    - Sublingual glands: These glands are found under the tongue in the floor of the mouth.    - Submandibular glands: These glands are found below the jawbone.         There are also hundreds of small (minor) salivary glands lining parts of the mouth, nose, and larynx that can be seen only with a microscope. Most small salivary gland tumors begin in the palate (roof of the mouth).   More than half of all salivary gland tumors are benign (not cancerous) and do not spread to other tissues.     Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.","To diagnose salivary gland cancer, the following types of tests are typically conducted:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: An assessment of the body for general signs of health and any unusual findings, such as lumps, along with a detailed health history.

2. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This imaging procedure uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

3. **CT Scan (Computed Tomography Scan)**: This test produces detailed images of the body from different angles, often utilizing a dye to enhance visibility.

4. **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography Scan)**: This scan detects malignant tumor cells by injecting a small amount of radioactive glucose into a vein, highlighting areas of increased glucose uptake, typical of cancer cells.

5. **Endoscopy**: This procedure involves inserting a thin, tube-like instrument with a camera (endoscope) into the mouth to inspect the mouth, throat, and larynx for abnormal areas.

6. **Biopsy**: This involves removing cells or tissues for microscopic examination to check for cancer signs. There are different types of biopsy:
   - **Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) Biopsy**: Removal of tissue or fluid with a thin needle; it's the most common type used for salivary gland cancer.
   - **Incisional Biopsy**: Removal of a portion of a lump or a sample of abnormal tissue.
   - **Surgical Biopsy**: Involves the removal of the entire mass if cancer cannot be diagnosed from smaller samples.

These tests help to detect and confirm the presence of salivary gland cancer effectively.",216,What types of tests are typically conducted to diagnose salivary gland cancer in patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed list of tests used to diagnose salivary gland cancer, directly addressing the question posed.

                    Childhood liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver.
                    The liver is one of the largest organs in the body. It has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. Three of the many important functions of the liver are:         - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine.    - To make bile to help digest fats from food.     - To store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy.           Liver cancer is rare in children and adolescents.
                
            	
                    There are different types of childhood liver cancer.
                    There are two main types of childhood liver cancer:         -  Hepatoblastoma: Hepatoblastoma is the most common type of childhood liver cancer. It usually affects children younger than 3 years of age.  In hepatoblastoma, the histology (how the cancer cells look under a microscope) affects the way the cancer is treated. The histology for hepatoblastoma may be one of the following:               - Pure fetal histology.      - Small cell undifferentiated histology.      - Non-pure fetal histology, non-small cell undifferentiated histology.              -  Hepatocellular carcinoma: Hepatocellular carcinoma usually affects older children and adolescents. It is more common in areas of Asia that have high rates of hepatitis infection than in the U.S.        The treatment of two less common types of childhood liver cancer is also discussed in this summary:          - Undifferentiated embryonal sarcoma of the liver: This type of liver cancer usually occurs in children between 5 and 10 years of age. It often spreads all through the liver and/or to the lungs.    - Infantile choriocarcinoma of the liver is a very rare tumor that starts in the placenta and spreads to the fetus. The tumor is usually found during the first few months of life. Also, the mother of the child may be diagnosed with choriocarcinoma. Choriocarcinoma is a type of gestational trophoblastic disease and needs treatment. See the Gestational Trophoblastic Disease Treatment summary for information on the treatment of choriocarcinoma.         This summary is about the treatment of primary liver cancer (cancer that begins in the liver). Treatment of metastatic liver cancer, which is cancer that begins in other parts of the body and spreads to the liver, is not discussed in this summary. Primary liver cancer can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. See the PDQ summary on Adult Primary Liver Cancer Treatment for more information on the treatment of adults.","Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and hepatoblastoma differ significantly in terms of age prevalence and geographic factors associated with hepatitis infection. 

Hepatocellular carcinoma typically occurs in older individuals, with most patients being older than 40 years, while hepatoblastoma is primarily a childhood cancer, most commonly affecting children under the age of 3. 

In terms of geographic factors, HCC is strongly associated with infections from hepatitis B and C, which are more prevalent in certain regions, particularly in parts of Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where chronic hepatitis infections are common. In contrast, hepatoblastoma is not directly linked to hepatitis viruses and does not have the same geographic prevalence related to hepatitis infections.

Use of tobacco products and drinking too much alcohol can affect the risk of laryngeal cancer.Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.,"The difference between risk factors and the actual development of laryngeal cancer lies in their definitions and implications. 

Risk factors are conditions or behaviors that increase the likelihood of developing a disease, but do not guarantee that someone will get the disease. For laryngeal cancer, two significant risk factors are the use of tobacco products and excessive alcohol consumption. While these factors can elevate the risk of developing laryngeal cancer, having them does not mean that an individual will definitely develop the disease.

On the other hand, the actual development of laryngeal cancer involves the formation of malignant (cancer) cells in the tissues of the larynx, leading to the disease itself. This process occurs after certain changes in the cells, which can be influenced by the presence of risk factors, but is not solely dependent on them. Thus, while risk factors can contribute to the likelihood of cell changes that lead to cancer, the actual development is a specific biological event occurring in the laryngeal tissues.",398,Can you explain the difference between risk factors and the actual development of laryngeal cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively explains the distinction between risk factors and the actual development of laryngeal cancer, incorporating the key points from the original answer regarding tobacco and alcohol as significant risk factors.

"Diagnostic tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   X-rays : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.
                         - If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma, a biopsy is done. One of the following types of biopsies is usually used:          -   Core needle biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.     -   Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.     -   Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin. This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy. If cancer cells remain, the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body.  An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy. This is done to show where the original tumor is and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy.        The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect the success of later surgery to remove the tumor. If possible, the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy.    In order to plan the best treatment, the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests. Tissue samples will be taken from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and other areas that may have cancer cells. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the type and grade of the tumor. The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing. High-grade and mid-grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low-grade tumors.    Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose, the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma.   One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples:         -   Molecular test : A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas.    -   Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for changes in the expression of certain genes. When genes are expressed they make specific proteins that are needed for the structure, function, and monitoring of the bodys tissues and organs. This test is done in order to identify the type of tumor.     -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, tumor or other tissue is viewed under a microscope to look for changes in the chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a type of cytogenetic analysis.    -   Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of cells. The antibody is usually linked to an enzyme or fluorescent dye that causes the cells that have that marker to become visible under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma.","Specialized laboratory tests, such as molecular tests and cytogenetic analysis, play a crucial role in identifying the type of soft tissue sarcoma. These tests help to detect specific genetic changes and characteristics within the tumor cells that are associated with different types of sarcomas. For example, molecular tests can check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in various soft tissue sarcomas, aiding in diagnosis and classification of the sarcoma type.

Cytogenetic analysis involves examining the tumor cells for changes in chromosomes, which can provide vital information about the tumor's genetic profile. This analysis may include techniques like fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The results from these specialized tests inform the pathologist in determining the grade and type of the sarcoma, which are essential for planning effective treatment strategies. Overall, these tests are integral in enhancing diagnostic accuracy and tailoring treatment approaches for patients with soft tissue sarcoma.",505,"What role do specialized laboratory tests, such as molecular tests and cytogenetic analysis, play in identifying the type of soft tissue sarcoma?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the role of specialized laboratory tests, specifically molecular tests and cytogenetic analysis, in identifying the type of soft tissue sarcoma.

                    A gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor is cancer that forms in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.
                    The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the body's digestive system. It helps to digest food, takes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food to be used by the body and helps pass waste material out of the body. The GI tract is made up of these and other organs:         -  Stomach.    -  Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum).    -  Colon.    -  Rectum.          Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors form from a certain type of neuroendocrine cell (a type of cell that is like a nerve cell and a hormone -making cell). These cells are scattered throughout the chest and abdomen but most are found in the GI tract. Neuroendocrine cells make hormones that help control digestive juices and the muscles used in moving food through the stomach and intestines. A GI carcinoid tumor may also make hormones and release them into the body.   GI carcinoid tumors are rare and most grow very slowly. Most of them occur in the small intestine, rectum, and appendix. Sometimes more than one tumor will form.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information related to GI and other types of carcinoid tumors:         -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment.    -  Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment.     -  Rectal Cancer Treatment.    -  Small Intestine Cancer Treatment.    -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment
                
                
                    Carcinoid syndrome may occur if the tumor spreads to the liver or other parts of the body.
                    The hormones made by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors are usually destroyed by liver enzymes in the blood. If the tumor has spread to the liver and the liver enzymes cannot destroy the extra hormones made by the tumor, high amounts of these hormones may remain in the body and cause carcinoid syndrome. This can also happen if tumor cells enter the blood. Signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include the following:         - Redness or a feeling of warmth in the face and neck.     - Abdominal pain.    - Feeling bloated.    - Diarrhea.    - Wheezing or other trouble breathing.    - Fast heartbeat.        These signs and symptoms may be caused by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors or by other conditions. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these signs or symptoms.","Carcinoid tumors, which are a type of neuroendocrine tumor, commonly form in specific sites within the gastrointestinal (GI) tract, particularly in the small intestine, rectum, and appendix. While gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors can occur in various parts of the GI tract, the small intestine is the most frequent site for these tumors, which is one factor contributing to their overall rarity. Despite being rare, carcinoid tumors are noted for their slow growth rate, making their detection often delayed until they have progressed or spread. Their uncommon nature is also reflected in their occurrence during assessments for other conditions, as they may remain asymptomatic in early stages.",73,"What are the common sites within the gastrointestinal tract where carcinoid tumors tend to form, and how does this relate to their overall rarity?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding common sites where carcinoid tumors form within the gastrointestinal tract and ties it to their rarity.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.
                    Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason, treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.    Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV. Treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In these patients, treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS. Medicine to prevent and treat infections, which can be serious, is also used.   For more information about AIDS and its treatment, please see the AIDSinfo website.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system (CNS).       Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.     Colony-stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. External radiation therapy is used to treat AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Colorectal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon or the rectum.
                    The colon and rectum are parts of the body's digestive system. The digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the mouth, throat, esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are 6-8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).      Cancer that begins in the colon is called colon cancer, and cancer that begins in the rectum is called rectal cancer. Cancer that begins in either of these organs may also be called colorectal cancer.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about colorectal cancer:         -   Colorectal Cancer Prevention     -  Colon Cancer Treatment     -  Rectal Cancer Treatment     -  Genetics of Colorectal Cancer
                
                
                    Colorectal cancer is the second leading cause of death from cancer in the United States.
                    The number of new colorectal cancer cases and the number of deaths from colorectal cancer are decreasing a little bit each year. But in adults younger than 50 years, there has been a small increase in the number of new cases each year since 1998. Colorectal cancer is found more often in men than in women.","The risk of developing colorectal cancer is influenced by various factors, which can be categorized into risk factors and protective factors.

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Age**: The risk significantly increases after age 50.
2. **Family history of colorectal cancer**: A family history doubles the risk.
3. **Personal history**: This includes previous colorectal cancer or conditions like high-risk adenomas (large or abnormal polyps), ovarian cancer, and inflammatory bowel disease (like ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease).
4. **Inherited risk**: Genetic changes linked to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (Lynch Syndrome) increase risk.
5. **Alcohol**: Consuming 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day raises the risk.
6. **Cigarette smoking**: Smoking is associated with a higher risk of colorectal cancer and its recurrence after adenoma removal.
7. **Obesity**: Obesity is linked to increased risk and mortality from colorectal cancer.

**Protective Factors:**
1. **Physical activity**: Regular exercise decreases the risk.
2. **Aspirin**: Long-term use of aspirin has been shown to lower colorectal cancer risk.
3. **Combination hormone replacement therapy**: This has been found to reduce the risk in postmenopausal women.
4. **Polyp removal**: Removing larger adenomas (over 1 cm) may reduce the likelihood of developing cancer.

**Management of Risks:**
To manage these risk factors, individuals can:
- Engage in regular physical activity.
- Avoid tobacco use and limit alcohol consumption.
- Maintain a healthy weight and diet.
- Discuss the potential benefits and risks of aspirin or hormone replacement therapy with their healthcare provider.
- Have regular screening and polyp removal procedures as recommended by a healthcare professional.

                    A gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor is cancer that forms in the lining of the gastrointestinal tract.
                    The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the body's digestive system. It helps to digest food, takes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food to be used by the body and helps pass waste material out of the body. The GI tract is made up of these and other organs:         -  Stomach.    -  Small intestine (duodenum, jejunum, and ileum).    -  Colon.    -  Rectum.          Gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors form from a certain type of neuroendocrine cell (a type of cell that is like a nerve cell and a hormone -making cell). These cells are scattered throughout the chest and abdomen but most are found in the GI tract. Neuroendocrine cells make hormones that help control digestive juices and the muscles used in moving food through the stomach and intestines. A GI carcinoid tumor may also make hormones and release them into the body.   GI carcinoid tumors are rare and most grow very slowly. Most of them occur in the small intestine, rectum, and appendix. Sometimes more than one tumor will form.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information related to GI and other types of carcinoid tumors:         -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment.    -  Pancreatic Neuroendocrine Tumors (Islet Cell Tumors) Treatment.     -  Rectal Cancer Treatment.    -  Small Intestine Cancer Treatment.    -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment
                
                
                    Carcinoid syndrome may occur if the tumor spreads to the liver or other parts of the body.
                    The hormones made by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors are usually destroyed by liver enzymes in the blood. If the tumor has spread to the liver and the liver enzymes cannot destroy the extra hormones made by the tumor, high amounts of these hormones may remain in the body and cause carcinoid syndrome. This can also happen if tumor cells enter the blood. Signs and symptoms of carcinoid syndrome include the following:         - Redness or a feeling of warmth in the face and neck.     - Abdominal pain.    - Feeling bloated.    - Diarrhea.    - Wheezing or other trouble breathing.    - Fast heartbeat.        These signs and symptoms may be caused by gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors or by other conditions. Talk to your doctor if you have any of these signs or symptoms.","Imaging studies and laboratory tests that are typically used to diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors include:

1. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: To check for certain hormones released into the blood by carcinoid tumors.
2. **Tumor Marker Tests**: Measures substances like chromogranin A that are produced by neuroendocrine tumors.
3. **Twenty-four-Hour Urine Test**: Assesses levels of substances such as 5-HIAA or serotonin that may indicate carcinoid syndrome.
4. **MIBG Scan**: Uses radioactive material to detect neuroendocrine tumors.
5. **CT Scan**: Generates detailed images of the body to identify tumors.
6. **MRI**: Utilizes a magnet and radio waves for imaging.
7. **PET Scan**: Looks for malignant tumor cells by detecting glucose uptake.
8. **Endoscopic Ultrasound**: Combines endoscopy and ultrasound to visualize gastrointestinal tissues.
9. **Upper Endoscopy**: Examines the upper GI tract for abnormalities.
10. **Colonoscopy**: Inspects the colon for polyps or cancer.
11. **Capsule Endoscopy**: Uses a swallowed camera to visualize the small intestine.
12. **Biopsy**: Involves removing tissue samples for microscopic examination.

Some women receive a treatment called intraperitoneal radiation therapy, in which radioactive liquid is put directly in the abdomen through a catheter. Intraperitoneal radiation therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor.

                    After AIDS-related lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment, but AIDS-related lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. The blood sample will be checked for the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase).     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for Epstein-Barr virus. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Stages of AIDS-related lymphoma may include E and S.
                    AIDS-related lymphoma may be described as follows:         - E: ""E"" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas.    - S: ""S"" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:
                    Stage I      Stage I AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE.             -  Stage I: Cancer is found in one lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen).     -  Stage IE: Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes.              Stage II     Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE.             -  Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     -  Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm. Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes.              Stage III      Stage III AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE+S.             -  Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     -  Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.     -  Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.     -  Stage IIIE+S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen.              Stage IV     In stage IV AIDS-related lymphoma, the cancer:             - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or     - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or     - is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas).           Patients who are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus or whose AIDS-related lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system (CNS).
                
                
                    For treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:
                    Peripheral/systemic lymphoma     Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may spread throughout the body, including to the brain or bone marrow. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.        Primary CNS lymphoma     Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus. Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.","During the staging process of AIDS-related lymphoma to determine the spread of cancer cells, the following tests are typically performed:

1. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: These check the amounts of certain substances in the blood, including Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH) levels, which can indicate disease.
2. **CT Scan (CAT Scan)**: This imaging procedure creates detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lungs, lymph nodes, and liver.
3. **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography Scan)**: This procedure detects malignant tumor cells by using radioactive glucose, highlighting areas of increased metabolic activity associated with cancer.
4. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This imaging procedure uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed pictures of the body's internal structures, particularly useful for assessing the brain and spinal cord.
5. **Lumbar Puncture**: This procedure collects cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) to check for cancer spread to the brain and spinal cord.

The following procedure also may be used to determine the stage:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.

                    After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Abdominal lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with nonseminoma, removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer:               -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for testicular cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IA, cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle. All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IB, cancer:                   -  is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle; or       - has spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle; or       - is in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle.           All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IS, cancer is found anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or the scrotum and either:                  - all tumor marker levels are slightly above normal; or       - one or more tumor marker levels are moderately above normal or high.                          Stage II     Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIA, cancer:                   - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen, none larger than 2 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIB, cancer is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and either:                  - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen; at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 centimeters, but none are larger than 5 centimeters; or       - has spread to more than 5 lymph nodes; the lymph nodes are not larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to a lymph node in the abdomen that is larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIIA, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen; and       - has spread to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs.            Tumor marker levels may range from normal to slightly above normal.     - In stage IIIB, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.           The level of one or more tumor markers is moderately above normal.     - In stage IIIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.            The level of one or more tumor markers is high. or Cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen; and       - has not spread to distant lymph nodes or the lung but has spread to other parts of the body.           Tumor marker levels may range from normal to high.","In the context of testicular cancer, Stage 0 is defined as Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia (TIN). In this stage, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells have the potential to become cancerous and can spread into nearby normal tissue. Importantly, all tumor marker levels are normal at this stage. Stage 0 signifies that the disease is at a very early stage, before any invasive cancer has formed, indicating a low level of progression of the disease.",586,"In the context of testicular cancer, how is Stage 0 defined and what does it signify about the progression of the disease?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately defines Stage 0 of testicular cancer, referencing Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia and detailing the presence of abnormal cells, the normal tumor marker levels, and significance of being an early stage without invasive cancer. This aligns closely with the information provided in the original answer."
Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called neutrophils. Neutrophils are infection -fighting blood cells that surround and destroy dead cells and foreign substances (such as bacteria). The spleen and liver may swell because of the extra neutrophils. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia may stay the same or it may progress quickly to acute leukemia.,"Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL) primarily differs from other types of leukemia in terms of symptoms and progression as follows:

1. **Symptoms**: 
   - The symptoms specific to chronic neutrophilic leukemia include swelling of the spleen and liver, which can result from the excessive accumulation of neutrophils. In contrast, other leukemias may present symptoms like fever, tiredness, or swollen lymph nodes without the specific involvement of spleen or liver noted in CNL.

2. **Progression**: 
   - CNL can remain stable for a period but has the potential to progress rapidly to acute leukemia. This is a distinguishing feature compared to some other leukemias, which may have a more consistent progression pattern or different stages with varied symptoms.

In conclusion, the unique symptoms of organ swelling due to neutrophil accumulation and the potential for rapid progression to acute leukemia highlight the distinct nature of chronic neutrophilic leukemia compared to other leukemia types.",537,In what ways does chronic neutrophilic leukemia differ from other types of leukemia in terms of symptoms and progression?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear differentiation of chronic neutrophilic leukemia in terms of symptoms and progression, directly building on the information provided in the original answer.

"Different factors increase or decrease the risk of lung cancer.
                    		Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.

		                    Screening tests have risks.
		                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
		                
		                
		                    The risks of lung cancer screening tests include the following:
		                    Finding lung cancer may not improve health or help you live longer.    Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have lung cancer that has already spread to other places in your body.     When a screening test result leads to the diagnosis and treatment of a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening, it is called overdiagnosis. It is not known if treatment of these cancers would help you live longer than if no treatment were given, and treatments for cancer may have serious side effects. Harms of treatment may happen more often in people who have medical problems caused by heavy or long-term smoking.       False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though lung cancer is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests (such as biopsy), which also have risks. A biopsy to diagnose lung cancer can cause part of the lung to collapse. Sometimes surgery is needed to reinflate the lung. Harms of diagnostic tests may happen more often in patients who have medical problems caused by heavy or long-term smoking.        Chest x-rays and low-dose spiral CT scans expose the chest to radiation.     Radiation exposure from chest x-rays and low-dose spiral CT scans may increase the risk of cancer. Younger people and people at low risk for lung cancer are more likely to develop lung cancer caused by radiation exposure. .        Talk to your doctor about your risk for lung cancer and your need for screening tests.    Talk to your doctor or other health care provider about your risk for lung cancer, whether a screening test is right for you, and about the benefits and harms of the screening test. You should take part in the decision about whether a screening test is right for you. (See the PDQ summary on Cancer Screening Overview for more information.)","Several factors can increase or decrease the risk of developing lung cancer, functioning as either risk or protective factors.

**Risk Factors:**
1. **Tobacco Smoking:** This includes cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking. It is the most significant risk factor, causing about 9 out of 10 lung cancer cases in men and 8 out of 10 in women. The risk increases with the number of cigarettes smoked and the duration of smoking.
2. **Secondhand Smoke:** Exposure to secondhand smoke is also a risk factor, as it contains the same cancer-causing agents found in tobacco smoke.
3. **Family History:** A family history of lung cancer doubles the risk for individuals with relatives who have had the disease.
4. **HIV Infection:** Individuals infected with HIV have more than twice the risk of developing lung cancer compared to those who are not infected.
5. **Environmental Risk Factors:** This includes exposure to radon, radiation from atomic bomb events, radiation therapy, and imaging tests (like CT scans), which can increase lung cancer risk.
6. **Workplace Exposures:** Substances such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, tar, and soot are linked to higher lung cancer risk, particularly in occupational settings.
7. **Air Pollution:** Living in areas with higher levels of air pollution has been shown to increase lung cancer risk.
8. **Beta Carotene Supplements (in heavy smokers):** Taking beta carotene supplements can increase lung cancer risk, especially for smokers.

**Protective Factors:**
1. **Not Smoking:** The best way to prevent lung cancer is by not smoking.
2. **Quitting Smoking:** Smokers can lower their risk by quitting; after 10 years of cessation, the risk decreases by 30% to 50%.
3. **Lower Exposure to Workplace Risk Factors:** Implementing laws and regulations to minimize exposure to harmful substances at work can help reduce risk.
4. **Lower Exposure to Radon:** Taking measures to reduce radon levels in homes can protect against lung cancer.

**Uncertain Factors:**
- **Diet and Physical Activity:** Some studies indicate that diets rich in fruits and vegetables or higher levels of physical activity might lower risk, but it remains unclear if this effect is independent of smoking status.

**Ineffective Factors:**
- **Beta Carotene Supplements (in nonsmokers) and Vitamin E Supplements:** These do not lower the risk of lung cancer, according to studies.

By avoiding risk factors and promoting protective factors, individuals may reduce their chances of developing lung cancer.",87,"What are the different factors that can increase or decrease the risk of developing lung cancer, and how do they function as risk or protective factors?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question regarding the factors that increase or decrease the risk of lung cancer, aligning closely with the original answer which discusses risk factors and protective factors.

                    After AIDS-related lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment, but AIDS-related lymphoma is usually advanced when it is diagnosed.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. The blood sample will be checked for the level of LDH (lactate dehydrogenase).     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, lymph nodes, and liver, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. The sample may also be checked for Epstein-Barr virus. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Stages of AIDS-related lymphoma may include E and S.
                    AIDS-related lymphoma may be described as follows:         - E: ""E"" stands for extranodal and means the cancer is found in an area or organ other than the lymph nodes or has spread to tissues beyond, but near, the major lymphatic areas.    - S: ""S"" stands for spleen and means the cancer is found in the spleen.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for AIDS-related lymphoma:
                    Stage I      Stage I AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage I and stage IE.             -  Stage I: Cancer is found in one lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen).     -  Stage IE: Cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes.              Stage II     Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage II and stage IIE.             -  Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     -  Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm. Cancer is also found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes.              Stage III      Stage III AIDS-related lymphoma is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE+S.             -  Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     -  Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.     -  Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.     -  Stage IIIE+S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen.              Stage IV     In stage IV AIDS-related lymphoma, the cancer:             - is found throughout one or more organs that are not part of a lymphatic area (lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen) and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or     - is found in one organ that is not part of a lymphatic area and has spread to organs or lymph nodes far away from that organ; or     - is found in the liver, bone marrow, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), or lungs (other than cancer that has spread to the lungs from nearby areas).           Patients who are infected with the Epstein-Barr virus or whose AIDS-related lymphoma affects the bone marrow have an increased risk of the cancer spreading to the central nervous system (CNS).
                
                
                    For treatment, AIDS-related lymphomas are grouped based on where they started in the body, as follows:
                    Peripheral/systemic lymphoma     Lymphoma that starts in the lymph system or elsewhere in the body, other than the brain, is called peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It may spread throughout the body, including to the brain or bone marrow. It is often diagnosed in an advanced stage.        Primary CNS lymphoma     Primary CNS lymphoma starts in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord). It is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus. Lymphoma that starts somewhere else in the body and spreads to the central nervous system is not primary CNS lymphoma.","Stage I AIDS-related lymphoma is characterized by cancer being found in one lymphatic area, which may include one lymph node group, tonsils and nearby tissue, thymus, or spleen. It can also be classified as Stage IE if the cancer is found in one organ or area outside the lymph nodes.

In contrast, Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma involves the presence of cancer in two or more lymph node groups, either above or below the diaphragm. It can further be classified as Stage IIE if, in addition to the multiple lymph nodes affected, there is also cancer found outside the lymph nodes in one organ or area on the same side of the diaphragm as the affected lymph nodes.

In summary, the main difference lies in the number of lymphatic areas affected: Stage I involves a single area, while Stage II indicates multiple areas with possible additional extranodal involvement. This difference signifies a progression in the spread of the cancer within the lymphatic system.",309,Can you explain the differences between Stage I and Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma in terms of cancer locations and progression?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear and accurate description of the differences between Stage I and Stage II AIDS-related lymphoma, directly addressing the question.

"Imaging studies and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers.  Most malignant germ cell tumors release tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to detect extracranial germ cell tumors:                - Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      - Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).          For testicular germ cell tumors, blood levels of the tumor markers help show if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. In some cases, the tumor is removed during surgery and then a biopsy is done. The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.       -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.","To diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, specific imaging techniques utilized include:

1. **Chest X-ray**: This is used to create images of the organs and bones inside the chest to detect any abnormalities.

2. **CT Scan (Computed Tomography)**: This procedure involves taking a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body from different angles. A computer linked to an x-ray machine produces images that may require the use of a dye for clearer visualization of organs or tissues.

3. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This technique employs a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to generate detailed images of areas inside the body, offering high-resolution images that can reveal abnormalities in tissues.

4. **Ultrasound Exam**: High-energy sound waves are used to create echoes that form a sonogram, providing visual assessments of internal tissues or organs.

The differences in approach among these imaging techniques lie primarily in their method of visualization and the details they can provide. For example:

- **X-rays** provide a straightforward two-dimensional view of structures, useful for basic assessments.
- **CT scans** offer cross-sectional images, making it easier to identify the size and location of tumors.
- **MRI** is particularly valuable for soft tissue contrast and complex anatomy, such as around the spine or in the abdomen.
- **Ultrasound** is non-invasive, can be performed quickly, and does not involve radiation, making it suitable for initial evaluations, especially in younger children.

In summary, while all these imaging techniques aim to diagnose and provide information regarding childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, they operate through different modalities and can provide varying levels of detail based on specific clinical needs.",107,"What specific imaging techniques are utilized to diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, and how do they differ in their approach?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed overview of the specific imaging techniques used to diagnose childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, directly reflecting the original answer's mention of chest X-rays, CT scans, MRIs, and ultrasound exams.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Where the tumor is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels.        For patients who smoke, the chance of recovery is better if they stop smoking before beginning radiation therapy.   Treatment options depend on the following:          - The stage of the cancer.    - The size of the tumor and where it is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the patient's appearance and ability to talk and eat can stay the same.    - The patient's age and general health.        Patients who have had lip and oral cavity cancer have an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important. Clinical trials are studying the use of retinoid drugs to reduce the risk of a second head and neck cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","The stage of lip and oral cavity cancer plays a crucial role in determining both the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for patients. 

1. **Prognosis**: The stage of the cancer significantly impacts the patient's outlook. For instance, prognosis depends on:
   - The stage at which the cancer is diagnosed (ranging from Stage 0 to Stage IV).

"Tests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.
                    Screening tests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.   In general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.    Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and adrenal tumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done after the child is 4 years old. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.   Children with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.   Some children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months for up to eight years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.
                
                
                    Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
                    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.    -   Renal function test : A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.    -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.

"Key Points
                    - Urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra.    - There are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra.     - A history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer.    - Signs of urethral cancer include bleeding or trouble with urination.     - Tests that examine the urethra and bladder are used to detect (find) and diagnose urethral cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Urethral cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the urethra.
                    The urethra is the tube that carries urine from the bladder to outside the body. In women, the urethra is about 1 inches long and is just above the vagina. In men, the urethra is about 8 inches long, and goes through the prostate gland and the penis to the outside of the body. In men, the urethra also carries semen.     Urethral cancer is a rare cancer that occurs more often in men than in women.
                
                
                    There are different types of urethral cancer that begin in cells that line the urethra.
                    These cancers are named for the types of cells that become malignant (cancer):         -  Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of urethral cancer. It forms in cells in the part of the urethra near the bladder in women, and in the lining of the urethra in the penis in men.    -  Transitional cell carcinoma forms in the area near the urethral opening in women, and in the part of the urethra that goes through the prostate gland in men.    -  Adenocarcinoma forms in the glands that are around the urethra in both men and women.         Urethral cancer can metastasize (spread) quickly to tissues around the urethra and is often found in nearby lymph nodes by the time it is diagnosed.
                
                
                    A history of bladder cancer can affect the risk of urethral cancer.
                    Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for urethral cancer include the following:         - Having a history of bladder cancer.     - Having conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra, including:               - Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), including human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16.      - Frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs).","A history of bladder cancer can significantly increase the risk of developing urethral cancer. This correlation is due to the shared tissue origins and potential for similar risk factors affecting both conditions. It is also noted that bladder and/or prostate cancer may occur simultaneously with urethral cancer. 

In addition to a prior history of bladder cancer, other important risk factors for urethral cancer should be considered. These include conditions that cause chronic inflammation in the urethra, such as sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) like human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16, and frequent urinary tract infections (UTIs). These risk factors can contribute to the likelihood of developing malignancies within the urethra.",298,"What are the implications of a history of bladder cancer on the development of urethral cancer, and what other risk factors should be considered?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and elaborates on the implications of a history of bladder cancer on the risk of developing urethral cancer, aligning closely with the original content.

                    Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.
                    The skin is the bodys largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells:         -  Squamous cells: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis.    -  Basal cells: Round cells under the squamous cells.    -  Melanocytes: Cells that make melanin and are found in the lower part of the epidermis. Melanin is the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to darken.          Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in skin that is often exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.
                
                
                    There are different types of cancer that start in the skin.
                    The most common types are basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma, which are nonmelanoma skin cancers. Nonmelanoma skin cancers rarely spread to other parts of the body. Melanoma is a much rarer type of skin cancer. It is more likely to invade nearby tissues and spread to other parts of the body. Actinic keratosis is a skin condition that sometimes becomes squamous cell carcinoma.   This summary is about nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. See the following PDQ summaries for information on melanoma and other kinds of cancer that affect the skin:         -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment     -   Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment     -  Merkel Cell Carcinoma Treatment     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment     -  Genetics of Skin Cancer
                
                
                    Nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis often appear as a change in the skin.
                    Not all changes in the skin are a sign of nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis. Check with your doctor if you notice any changes in your skin.    Signs of nonmelanoma skin cancer include the following:         - A sore that does not heal.    - Areas of the skin that are:               - Raised, smooth, shiny, and look pearly.       - Firm and look like a scar, and may be white, yellow, or waxy.      - Raised, and red or reddish-brown.       - Scaly, bleeding or crusty.","Skin cancer is most commonly found in areas of the body that are frequently exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms. This location is significant because these areas receive the most ultraviolet (UV) radiation from the sun, which is a major risk factor for developing skin cancer. The skin's sensitivity to UV radiation increases the likelihood of skin cancer in these sun-exposed regions.",112,"In which specific areas of the body is skin cancer most commonly found, and why is this location significant in terms of sun exposure?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the specific areas of the body where skin cancer is most commonly found and provides the reasoning related to sun exposure, which directly aligns with the information presented in the original answer."

                    Myelodysplastic syndromes are a group of cancers in which immature blood cells in the bone marrow do not mature or become healthy blood cells.
                    In a healthy person, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time.     A blood stem cell may become a lymphoid stem cell or a myeloid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.     - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.          In a patient with a myelodysplastic syndrome, the blood stem cells (immature cells) do not become mature red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the bone marrow. These immature blood cells, called blasts, do not work the way they should and either die in the bone marrow or soon after they go into the blood. This leaves less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets to form in the bone marrow. When there are fewer healthy blood cells, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.
                
                
                    The different types of myelodysplastic syndromes are diagnosed based on certain changes in the blood cells and bone marrow.
                    -  Refractory anemia: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. The number of white blood cells and platelets is normal.    -  Refractory anemia with ring sideroblasts: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. The red blood cells have too much iron inside the cell. The number of white blood cells and platelets is normal.    -  Refractory anemia with excess blasts: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia. Five percent to 19% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts. There also may be changes to the white blood cells and platelets. Refractory anemia with excess blasts may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML). See the PDQ Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment summary for more information.    -  Refractory cytopenia with multilineage dysplasia: There are too few of at least two types of blood cells (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts. If red blood cells are affected, they may have extra iron. Refractory cytopenia may progress to acute myeloid leukemia (AML).     -  Refractory cytopenia with unilineage dysplasia: There are too few of one type of blood cell (red blood cells, platelets, or white blood cells). There are changes in 10% or more of two other types of blood cells. Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts and less than 1% of the cells in the blood are blasts.     -  Unclassifiable myelodysplastic syndrome: The numbers of blasts in the bone marrow and blood are normal, and the disease is not one of the other myelodysplastic syndromes.     -  Myelodysplastic syndrome associated with an isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality: There are too few red blood cells in the blood and the patient has anemia.

                    There are 6 types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
                    The type of myeloproliferative neoplasm is based on whether too many red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets are being made. Sometimes the body will make too many of more than one type of blood cell, but usually one type of blood cell is affected more than the others are. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms include the following 6 types:         -  Chronic myelogenous leukemia.    -  Polycythemia vera.    -  Primary myelofibrosis (also called chronic idiopathic myelofibrosis).     -  Essential thrombocythemia.    -  Chronic neutrophilic leukemia.    -  Chronic eosinophilic leukemia.        These types are described below. Chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms sometimes become acute leukemia, in which too many abnormal white blood cells are made.","The six distinct types of chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms are differentiated based on the predominant type of blood cells produced. Each type is associated with an abnormal increase in specific blood cell lines:

1. **Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)** - Characterized primarily by an increase in white blood cells, particularly myeloid cells.

2. **Polycythemia vera (PV)** - Involves an overproduction of red blood cells, which can also result in increased white blood cells and platelets.

3. **Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)** - This condition usually leads to an increase in immature blood cells, particularly causing fibrosis of the bone marrow, which affects all blood cell lines.

4. **Essential thrombocythemia (ET)** - Defined by a significant increase in platelets.

5. **Chronic neutrophilic leukemia (CNL)** - Marked by an elevated level of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.

6. **Chronic eosinophilic leukemia (CEL)** - Characterized by a high number of eosinophils, another subtype of white blood cells.

                    After ovarian low malignant potential tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether abnormal cells have spread within the ovary or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests or procedures are used for staging. Staging laparotomy (a surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen to remove ovarian tissue) may be used. Most patients are diagnosed with stage I disease.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for ovarian low malignant potential tumor:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.             -  Stage IA: The tumor is found inside a single ovary.      -  Stage IB: The tumor is found inside both ovaries.      -  Stage IC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and one of the following is true:                   - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or        - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or        - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity).                          Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread into other areas of the pelvis. Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC.             -  Stage IIA: The tumor has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes (the long slender tubes through which eggs pass from the ovaries to the uterus).      -  Stage IIB: The tumor has spread to other tissue within the pelvis.      -  Stage IIC: The tumor is found inside one or both ovaries and has spread to the uterus and/or fallopian tubes, or to other tissue within the pelvis. Also, one of the following is true:                  - tumor cells are found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries; or       - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary has ruptured (broken open); or       - tumor cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity).                         Stage III     In stage III, the tumor is found in one or both ovaries and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or nearby lymph nodes. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.             -  Stage IIIA: The tumor is found in the pelvis only, but tumor cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum (tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers most of the organs in the abdomen), the small intestines, or the tissue that connects the small intestines to the wall of the abdomen.      -  Stage IIIB: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller.      -  Stage IIIC: The tumor has spread to the peritoneum and the tumor in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters and/or has spread to lymph nodes in the abdomen.           The spread of tumor cells to the surface of the liver is also considered stage III disease.        Stage IV     In stage IV, tumor cells have spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body, such as the lungs or tissue inside the liver.     Tumor cells in the fluid around the lungs is also considered stage IV disease.     Ovarian low malignant potential tumors almost never reach stage IV.","After diagnosing ovarian low malignant potential tumors, the following types of tests are performed to assess if abnormal cells have spread:

1. **Staging Laparotomy**: A surgical incision made in the wall of the abdomen to remove ovarian tissue and see if abnormal cells have spread.
   
2. **Physical Exam and History**: General health checks to look for signs of disease.

3. **Pelvic Exam**: An examination of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, and ovaries for signs of disease.

4. **Ultrasound Exam**: High-energy sound waves are used to create a picture of the ovaries and detect abnormalities.

5. **CT Scan (CAT Scan)**: Detailed pictures of areas inside the body are taken from different angles to look for abnormalities.

6. **CA 125 Assay**: A blood test that measures the level of CA 125, which can indicate the presence of abnormal cells.

7. **Chest X-ray**: To examine the organs and bones inside the chest for any signs of spread.

8. **Follow-Up Tests**: Some previously done tests may be repeated to monitor treatment effectiveness and check for recurrence.",374,What types of tests are performed after diagnosing ovarian low malignant potential tumors to assess if abnormal cells have spread?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding tests performed after diagnosing ovarian low malignant potential tumors to assess the spread of abnormal cells.

"Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult primary liver cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. An increased level of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) in the blood may be a sign of liver cancer. Other cancers and certain noncancerous conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, may also increase AFP levels. Sometimes the AFP level is normal even when there is liver cancer.    -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver cancer.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase CT. A spiral or helical CT scan makes a series of very detailed pictures of areas inside the body using an x-ray machine that scans the body in a spiral path.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the liver. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). To create detailed pictures of blood vessels in and near the liver, dye is injected into a vein. This procedure is called MRA (magnetic resonance angiography). Images may be taken at three different times after the dye is injected, to get the best picture of abnormal areas in the liver. This is called triple-phase MRI.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Procedures used to collect the sample of cells or tissues include the following:               -  Fine-needle aspiration biopsy : The removal of cells, tissue or fluid using a thin needle.      -  Core needle biopsy : The removal of cells or tissue using a slightly wider needle.      -  Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen to check for signs of disease. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Another instrument is inserted through the same or another incision to remove the tissue samples.          A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose adult primary liver cancer.","Imaging techniques like CT scans and MRIs play a crucial role in identifying abnormalities in the liver, particularly in the context of staging and diagnosing liver cancer. 

For adult primary liver cancer, after the diagnosis has been made, tests such as CT scans (computed tomography) are utilized to determine if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body. CT scans produce detailed pictures of areas inside the body from different angles, which helps in visualizing the size and location of tumors. Additionally, MRIs (magnetic resonance imaging) provide detailed images of soft tissues and can assist in differentiating between liver lesions and assessing the extent of disease.

In summary, these imaging techniques are essential for diagnosing liver conditions, understanding their progression, and planning treatment effectively.",529,What is the role of imaging techniques like CT scans and MRIs in identifying abnormalities in the liver?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the role of imaging techniques like CT scans and MRIs in identifying liver abnormalities, which is related to the original answer's focus on various tests for diagnosing liver cancer. However, it does not cover the full range of tests listed in the original answer nor does it mention tumor markers or other diagnostic procedures, leading to a partial relevance."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery). The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:          - The type of germ cell tumor.    - The type and level of any tumor markers.    - Where the tumor is in the brain or in the spinal cord.    -  Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord or to other parts of the body.     - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred (come back) after treatment.,"The location of a tumor in the brain or spinal cord significantly impacts the recovery chances for young patients due to several factors. Firstly, the prognosis (chance of recovery) is influenced by where the tumor is in the body. Tumors located in critical areas of the brain, such as the brain stem, which controls vital functions like breathing and heart rate, may be more challenging to treat and can lead to complications that affect recovery. Additionally, tumors that grow into or press on vital areas may impair the brain's functioning, potentially leaving residual cancer cells after surgery, impacting treatment outcomes and recovery chances.

Overall, the specific location of the tumor affects not only the surgical approach but also the severity and type of symptoms experienced by the child, which can further influence recovery and rehabilitation processes.",448,In what ways does the location of the tumor in the brain or spinal cord impact the recovery chances for young patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of the tumor's location in the brain or spinal cord on recovery chances, which is a specific aspect mentioned in the original answer.

                    Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease. See the General Information section for more information.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor.            -  Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs.              Stage III     In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.        Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity. It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes.","The method of metastasis in pancreatic cancer affects treatment options primarily based on the stage of the disease. This cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, or the blood, and the extent of its spread determines the treatment approach.

- **Stage I and II**: If the cancer has not spread beyond the pancreas or has only spread to nearby tissues, surgery may be a viable option, either alone or followed by chemotherapy or chemoradiation. 

- **Stage III**: At this stage, when cancer has spread to major blood vessels or nearby lymph nodes, treatment may involve palliative surgery or stenting to relieve symptoms, as well as chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation.

- **Stage IV**: For advanced cancer that has metastasized to distant organs such as the liver or lungs, treatment focuses on palliative care and managing symptoms, typically using chemotherapy with or without targeted therapies. 

The method of metastasis significantly impacts the chances of surgical intervention and the choice of palliative versus curative treatment, illustrating how the stage of metastasis directly correlates with available treatment options.",676,How does the method of metastasis affect the treatment options for pancreatic cancer patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses the original content regarding the stages of pancreatic cancer and how the method of metastasis influences treatment options.

"The risk factors for childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, and MDS are similar. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your childs doctor if you think your child may be at risk. These and other factors may increase the risk of childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, and MDS:         - Having a brother or sister, especially a twin, with leukemia.    - Being Hispanic.    - Being exposed to cigarette smoke or alcohol before birth.     - Having a personal history of aplastic anemia.    - Having a personal or family history of MDS.    - Having a family history of AML.    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.    - Being exposed to ionizing radiation or chemicals such as benzene.    - Having certain genetic disorders, such as:               - Down syndrome.      -  Fanconi anemia.      -  Neurofibromatosis type 1.      -  Noonan syndrome.      -  Shwachman-Diamond syndrome.","A personal history of aplastic anemia plays a significant role in increasing the likelihood of developing Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) or related disorders.

                    Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.
                    Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo.

                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.","The evidence regarding the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents like nicotinamide and celecoxib in reducing skin cancer risk is as follows:

1. **Nicotinamide (Vitamin B3)**: Studies have shown that nicotinamide helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in individuals who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking it. However, more studies are needed to determine if nicotinamide can prevent nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or recurring.

2. **Celecoxib**: A study involving patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer indicated that those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Despite this, celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.

Overall, while there is some evidence suggesting that celecoxib may reduce recurrence rates of nonmelanoma skin cancer and nicotinamide may help prevent new actinic keratoses, there remains uncertainty about their effectiveness in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancer itself. More research is necessary to reach definitive conclusions.",207,What evidence exists regarding the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents like nicotinamide and celecoxib in reducing skin cancer risk?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses the question about the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents nicotinamide and celecoxib in reducing skin cancer risk.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Treatment of GI carcinoid tumors usually includes surgery. One of the following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Endoscopic resection: Surgery to remove a small tumor that is on the inside lining of the GI tract. An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus to the stomach and sometimes, the duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light, a lens for viewing, and a tool for removing tumor tissue.     -  Local excision: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of normal tissue around it.      -  Resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the organ that contains cancer. Nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.     -  Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy carcinoid tumor tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument.      -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that release high-energy radio waves (similar to microwaves) that kill cancer cells. The probe may be inserted through the skin or through an incision (cut) in the abdomen.     -  Liver transplant: Surgery to remove the whole liver and replace it with a healthy donated liver.     -  Hepatic artery embolization: A procedure to embolize (block) the hepatic artery, which is the main blood vessel that brings blood into the liver. Blocking the flow of blood to the liver helps kill cancer cells growing there.               Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Radiopharmaceutical therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy. Radiation is given to the tumor using a drug that has a radioactive substance, such as iodine I 131, attached to it. The radioactive substance kills the tumor cells.     External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery is a type of regional chemotherapy that may be used to treat a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor that has spread to the liver. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with a substance that embolizes (blocks) the artery, and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue is a treatment that stops extra hormones from being made. GI carcinoid tumors are treated with octreotide or lanreotide which are injected under the skin or into the muscle. Octreotide and lanreotide may also have a small effect on stopping tumor growth.
                
                
                    Treatment for carcinoid syndrome may also be needed.
                    Treatment of carcinoid syndrome may include the following:          - Hormone therapy with a somatostatin analogue stops extra hormones from being made. Carcinoid syndrome is treated with octreotide or lanreotide to lessen flushing and diarrhea. Octreotide and lanreotide may also help slow tumor growth.     -  Interferon therapy stimulates the bodys immune system to work better and lessens flushing and diarrhea. Interferon may also help slow tumor growth.    - Taking medicine for diarrhea.    - Taking medicine for skin rashes.    - Taking medicine to breathe easier.    - Taking medicine before having anesthesia for a medical procedure.        Other ways to help treat carcinoid syndrome include avoiding things that cause flushing or difficulty breathing such as alcohol, nuts, certain cheeses and foods with capsaicin, such as chili peppers. Avoiding stressful situations and certain types of physical activity can also help treat carcinoid syndrome.   For some patients with carcinoid heart syndrome, a heart valve replacement may be done.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Several types of targeted therapy are being studied in the treatment of GI carcinoid tumors.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

These include:

1. **Hormone Therapy**: The primary approach for treating carcinoid syndrome involves hormone therapy with somatostatin analogues such as octreotide and lanreotide. These medications help to stop the production of excess hormones that may contribute to the symptoms of carcinoid syndrome, such as flushing and diarrhea. Additionally, octreotide and lanreotide may have a modest effect on slowing tumor growth.

2. **Interferon Therapy**: This therapy stimulates the immune system to better manage syndrome symptoms and may also help in slowing tumor growth.

3. **Symptomatic Treatment**: Medications may be provided for specific symptoms, including:
   - Medications for diarrhea.
   - Medications for skin rashes.
   - Bronchodilators for breathing difficulties.
   - Premedication before anesthesia during medical procedures.

4. **Lifestyle Modifications**: Patients are advised to avoid triggers that may worsen symptoms, such as alcohol, certain foods (like nuts, cheeses, and spicy foods), and stressful situations.

5. **Surgical Interventions**: In cases involving carcinoid heart syndrome, surgical procedures such as heart valve replacement might be necessary.

Overall, medications like octreotide play a vital role in managing the hormonal effects caused by GI carcinoid tumors, significantly improving the quality of life for affected patients.",79,"What strategies are recommended for managing carcinoid syndrome in patients with GI carcinoid tumors, and how do hormonal therapies like octreotide contribute to this management?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately details the recommended strategies for managing carcinoid syndrome in patients with GI carcinoid tumors, closely aligning with the key points presented in the original answer.

1. **Presence of Joint Pain**: If there are unexplained fractures along with joint pain, it may indicate an underlying issue such as bone cancer, including osteosarcoma or MFH.

2. **Unexplained Swelling**: Swelling over a bone or bony part of the body accompanying unexplained fractures can be a significant sign, signaling potential malignancy.

3. **Age Factor**: Osteosarcoma is most common in adolescents, so if the individual experiencing unexplained fractures falls within this age group, it warrants greater concern.

4. **History of Risk Factors**: If the individual has a history of past treatment with radiation or specific genetic syndromes (such as Li-Fraumeni syndrome or hereditary retinoblastoma), they may have an increased risk for developing osteosarcoma.

5. **Previous Bone Health Issues**: If there is any history of weakened bone conditions or previous cancers, unexplained fractures should be evaluated for potential malignancy.

"Being infected with certain types of the hepatitis virus can cause hepatitis and increase the risk of liver cancer.
                    Hepatitis is most commonly caused by the hepatitis virus. Hepatitis is a disease that causes inflammation (swelling) of the liver. Damage to the liver from hepatitis that lasts a long time can increase the risk of liver cancer.    There are six types of the hepatitis virus. Hepatitis A (HAV), hepatitis B (HBV), and hepatitis C (HCV) are the three most common types. These three viruses cause similar symptoms, but the ways they spread and affect the liver are different.    The Hepatitis A vaccine and the hepatitis B vaccine prevent infection with hepatitis A and hepatitis B. There is no vaccine to prevent infection with hepatitis C. If a person has had one type of hepatitis in the past, it is still possible to get the other types.   Hepatitis viruses include:     Hepatitis A    Hepatitis A is caused by eating food or drinking water infected with hepatitis A virus. It does not lead to chronic disease. People with hepatitis A usually get better without treatment.       Hepatitis B    Hepatitis B is caused by contact with the blood, semen, or other body fluid of a person infected with hepatitis B virus. It is a serious infection that may become chronic and cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). This may lead to liver cancer. Blood banks test all donated blood for hepatitis B, which greatly lowers the risk of getting the virus from blood transfusions.       Hepatitis C    Hepatitis C is caused by contact with the blood of a person infected with hepatitis C virus. Hepatitis C may range from a mild illness that lasts a few weeks to a serious, lifelong illness. Most people who have hepatitis C develop a chronic infection that may cause scarring of the liver (cirrhosis). This may lead to liver cancer. Blood banks test all donated blood for hepatitis C, which greatly lowers the risk of getting the virus from blood transfusions.       Hepatitis D    Hepatitis D develops in people already infected with hepatitis B. It is caused by hepatitis D virus (HDV) and is spread through contact with infected blood or dirty needles, or by having unprotected sex with a person infected with HDV. Hepatitis D causes acute hepatitis.       Hepatitis E    Hepatitis E is caused by hepatitis E virus (HEV). Hepatitis E can be spread through oral- anal contact or by drinking infected water. Hepatitis E is rare in the United States.       Hepatitis G    Being infected with hepatitis G virus (HGV) has not been shown to cause liver cancer.
               
               
                    Key Points
                    - Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.    - The following risk factors may increase the risk of liver cancer:         - Hepatitis B and C     - Cirrhosis     - Aflatoxin        - The following protective factor may decrease the risk of liver cancer:         - Hepatitis B vaccine        - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.     - New ways to prevent liver cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                
                
                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following risk factors may increase the risk of liver cancer:
                    Hepatitis B and C    Having chronic hepatitis B or chronic hepatitis C increases the risk of developing liver cancer. The risk is even greater for people with both hepatitis B and C. Also, the longer the hepatitis infection lasts (especially hepatitis C), the greater the risk.    In a study of patients with chronic hepatitis C, those who were treated to lower their iron levels by having blood drawn and eating a low-iron diet were less likely to develop liver cancer than those who did not have this treatment.       Cirrhosis    The risk of developing liver cancer is increased for people who have cirrhosis, a disease in which healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue. The scar tissue blocks the flow of blood through the liver and keeps it from working as it should. Chronic alcoholism and chronic hepatitis C are the most common causes of cirrhosis.       Aflatoxin    The risk of developing liver cancer may be increased by eating foods that contain aflatoxin (poison from a fungus that can grow on foods, such as grains and nuts, that have not been stored properly).","The presence of cirrhosis significantly increases the likelihood of developing liver cancer. Cirrhosis is a condition where healthy liver tissue is replaced by scar tissue, which impairs liver function and can lead to the development of malignant cells. The risk of liver cancer is particularly heightened for individuals who have cirrhosis due to underlying chronic liver diseases.

Common causes that lead to cirrhosis include chronic alcoholism and chronic hepatitis C infection. These conditions contribute to the liver damage and scarring characteristic of cirrhosis, thereby elevating the risk for liver cancer.",698,Can you explain how the presence of cirrhosis affects the likelihood of developing liver cancer and what common causes lead to cirrhosis?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains how cirrhosis increases the likelihood of developing liver cancer and identifies chronic alcoholism and chronic hepatitis C as common causes of cirrhosis. This aligns well with the information provided in the original answer, making the generated answer relevant to the question asked."
"Tests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.
                    Screening tests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.   In general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.    Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and adrenal tumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done after the child is 4 years old. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.   Children with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.   Some children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months for up to eight years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.
                
                
                    Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
                    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.    -   Renal function test : A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.    -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye is injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -  X-ray: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.    -   PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:                - The size of the tumor.      - The stage of the cancer.      - Whether cancer is in one or both kidneys.      - Whether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.      - Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.      - Whether the patient is in a clinical trial.         A biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.","To diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors, several types of imaging procedures are typically used, including:

1. **Ultrasound Exam**: This is usually the first imaging test performed to check the kidneys. High-energy sound waves create images of the internal organs, allowing doctors to identify any abnormalities.
  
2. **CT Scan (Computed Tomography)**: This test provides detailed cross-sectional images of the abdomen and can help determine the size and extent of the tumor. A dye may be used to enhance the images.

3. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: This imaging technique uses magnets and radio waves to create detailed images of the body's internal structures, including the kidneys. A contrast agent may be used to help highlight the tumor.

4. **X-ray**: This may be used to visualize areas inside the body, including the chest and abdomen, to check for potential metastasis (spread of cancer).

5. **PET-CT Scan**: This combines PET and CT scans to provide detailed images and information about the metabolic activity of the tumor, helping to identify malignant cells.

6. **Biopsy**: Although primarily a diagnostic procedure rather than an imaging technique, it involves removing tissue to check for cancer cells.

These imaging procedures differ significantly from routine blood tests, such as a Complete Blood Count (CBC) or blood chemistry studies, which analyze blood samples for indicators of health, organ function, or abnormalities. Imaging procedures provide visual representations of internal organs and potential tumors, while blood tests offer biochemical data about the body's physiological state.",469,"What types of imaging procedures are typically used to diagnose Wilms tumor or other childhood kidney tumors, and how do these procedures differ from routine blood tests?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the types of imaging procedures used to diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors, mirroring the original answer's focus on diagnostic imaging. It also addresses the difference between imaging procedures and routine blood tests comprehensively, reflecting the intent and details provided in the original answer."

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following risk factors increase the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    Age    The risk of colorectal cancer increases after age 50. Most cases of colorectal cancer are diagnosed after age 50.       Family history of colorectal cancer    Having a parent, brother, sister, or child with colorectal cancer doubles a person's risk of colorectal cancer.       Personal history    Having a personal history of the following conditions increases the risk of colorectal cancer:             - Previous colorectal cancer.     - High-risk adenomas (colorectal polyps that are 1 centimeter or larger in size or that have cells that look abnormal under a microscope).     -  Ovarian cancer.     -  Inflammatory bowel disease (such as ulcerative colitis or Crohn disease).              Inherited risk    The risk of colorectal cancer is increased when certain gene changes linked to familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) or hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC or Lynch Syndrome) are inherited.       Alcohol    Drinking 3 or more alcoholic beverages per day increases the risk of colorectal cancer. Drinking alcohol is also linked to the risk of forming large colorectal adenomas (benign tumors).       Cigarette smoking    Cigarette smoking is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.    Smoking cigarettes is also linked to an increased risk of forming colorectal adenomas. Cigarette smokers who have had surgery to remove colorectal adenomas are at an increased risk for the adenomas to recur (come back).       Obesity     Obesity is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer and death from colorectal cancer.
                
                
                    The following protective factors decrease the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    Physical activity    A lifestyle that includes regular physical activity is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.       Aspirin    Studies have shown that taking aspirin lowers the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from colorectal cancer. The decrease in risk begins 10 to 20 years after patients start taking aspirin.    The possible harms of aspirin use (100 mg or less) daily or every other day include an increased risk of stroke and bleeding in the stomach and intestines. These risks may be greater among the elderly, men, and those with conditions linked to a higher than normal risk of bleeding.       Combination hormone replacement therapy      Studies have shown that combination hormone replacement therapy (HRT) that includes both estrogen and progestin lowers the risk of invasive colorectal cancer in postmenopausal women.     However, in women who take combination HRT and do develop colorectal cancer, the cancer is more likely to be advanced when it is diagnosed and the risk of dying from colorectal cancer is not decreased.    The possible harms of combination HRT include an increased risk of having:            -  Breast cancer.     - Heart disease.     -  Blood clots.              Polyp removal    Most colorectal polyps are adenomas, which may develop into cancer. Removing colorectal polyps that are larger than 1 centimeter (pea-sized) may lower the risk of colorectal cancer. It is not known if removing smaller polyps lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     The possible harms of polyp removal during colonoscopy or sigmoidoscopy include a tear in the wall of the colon and bleeding.
                
                
                    It is not clear if the following affect the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) other than aspirin    It is not known if the use of nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs or NSAIDs (such as sulindac, celecoxib, naproxen, and ibuprofen) lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     Studies have shown that taking the nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug celecoxib reduces the risk of colorectal adenomas (benign tumors) coming back after they have been removed. It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.     Taking sulindac or celecoxib has been shown to reduce the number and size of polyps that form in the colon and rectum of people with familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP). It is not clear if this results in a lower risk of colorectal cancer.    The possible harms of NSAIDs include:            -  Kidney problems.     - Bleeding in the stomach, intestines, or brain.     - Heart problems such as heart attack and congestive heart failure.              Calcium    It is not known if taking calcium supplements lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.        Diet    It is not known if a diet low in fat and meat and high in fiber, fruits, and vegetables lowers the risk of colorectal cancer.     Some studies have shown that a diet high in fat, proteins, calories, and meat increases the risk of colorectal cancer, but other studies have not.
                
                
                    The following factors do not affect the risk of colorectal cancer:
                    Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only    Hormone replacement therapy with estrogen only does not lower the risk of having invasive colorectal cancer or the risk of dying from colorectal cancer.       Statins    Studies have shown that taking statins (drugs that lower cholesterol) does not increase or decrease the risk of colorectal cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.     The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent colorectal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for colon cancer prevention trials or rectal cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients.","Some lifestyle changes that can help lower the risk of developing colorectal cancer include:

1. **Increasing Physical Activity**: Regular physical activity is linked to a decreased risk of colorectal cancer.

2. **Quitting Smoking**: Avoiding cigarette smoking can help lower the risk, as smoking is associated with an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

3. **Maintaining a Healthy Weight**: Avoiding obesity is important, as being overweight is linked to an increased risk of colorectal cancer.

4. **Limiting Alcohol Consumption**: Reducing alcohol intake, particularly to fewer than three alcoholic beverages per day, can lower the risk.

5. **Aspirin Use**: Taking aspirin may lower the risk of colorectal cancer and the risk of death from it, with a significant decrease in risk occurring 10 to 20 years after starting use.

6. **Polyp Removal**: If adenomatous polyps (larger than 1 cm) are found during screening, their removal may help reduce the risk of colorectal cancer.

                    After parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The following imaging tests may be used to determine if cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, bone, heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if parathyroid cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually parathyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic parathyroid cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    There is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer.
                    Parathyroid cancer is described as either localized or metastatic:         - Localized parathyroid cancer is found in a parathyroid gland and may have spread to nearby tissues.    - Metastatic parathyroid cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bone, sac around the heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes.","Cancer can spread from its original site through three primary mechanisms: tissue invasion, the lymphatic system, and the bloodstream. 

1. **Tissue:** Cancer can spread by infiltrating nearby tissues. This means that cancer cells grow directly into adjacent healthy tissues starting from the primary tumor.

2. **Lymphatic System:** Cancer cells may enter the lymph system, traveling through lymph vessels to reach distant sites in the body. When these cells form tumors in new locations, they are referred to as metastatic tumors, but remain classified as the same type of cancer as the original tumor.

3. **Bloodstream:** Similarly, cancer can spread via the blood. Once cancer cells invade the blood vessels, they can circulate throughout the body and establish new tumors in organs such as the lungs, liver, bones, or lymph nodes. Again, the tumors that form in these new locations are considered metastatic parathyroid cancer, not another type of cancer.

In the specific context of parathyroid cancer, when the cancer breaks away from the primary tumor in the parathyroid gland and travels through either the lymphatic system or bloodstream, it can establish secondary tumors in various organs, but these would still be categorized as parathyroid cancer.",132,"Can you explain the different ways through which cancer can spread from its original site, particularly in the context of parathyroid cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the ways cancer can spread, specifically mentioning the three mechanisms: tissue invasion, the lymphatic system, and the bloodstream.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    The treatment of adult AML usually has 2 phases.
                    The 2 treatment phases of adult AML are:         -  Remission induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission.    -  Post-remission therapy: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins after the leukemia is in remission. The goal of post-remission therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse. This phase is also called remission continuation therapy.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat adult AML that has spread to the brain and spinal cord. Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the subtype of AML being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord.       See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated and whether leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult AML.       Stem cell transplant     Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.        Other drug therapy     Arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia.    See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

These research studies are conducted to determine if new cancer treatments are safe and effective, potentially leading to advancements in standard treatment options. When clinical trials demonstrate that a new treatment improves outcomes compared to the standard care, it may become the new standard treatment.

Patients may decide to participate in clinical trials at different stages of their treatment journey. They can join before starting their treatment, during ongoing therapy, or after completing their standard treatment. Some clinical trials may be exclusive to patients who have not yet received treatment, while others might focus on those whose cancer has not improved or has recurred. By considering participation in a clinical trial, patients not only explore potentially beneficial new treatments but also contribute to the advancement of cancer research, which may improve future care for others facing similar challenges.",685,"What role do clinical trials play in the treatment of adult acute myeloid leukemia, and how might patients decide to participate before, during, or after standard treatment?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the role of clinical trials in treating adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), aligning well with the key points from the original answer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Photodynamic therapy      Photodynamic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue. Patients undergoing photodynamic therapy will need to limit the amount of time spent in sunlight.     In one type of photodynamic therapy, called psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy, the patient receives a drug called psoralen and then ultraviolet radiation is directed to the skin. In another type of photodynamic therapy, called extracorporeal photochemotherapy, the patient is given drugs and then some blood cells are taken from the body, put under a special ultraviolet A light, and put back into the body.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Sometimes, total skin electron beam (TSEB) radiation therapy is used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. This is a type of external radiation treatment in which a radiation therapy machine aims electrons (tiny, invisible particles) at the skin covering the whole body.     Ultraviolet B (UVB) radiation therapy uses a special lamp or laser that directs UVB radiation at the skin.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Sometimes the chemotherapy is topical (put on the skin in a cream, lotion, or ointment). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Other drug therapy     Topical corticosteroids are used to relieve red, swollen, and inflamed skin. They are a type of steroid. Topical corticosteroids may be in a cream, lotion, or ointment.     Retinoids, such as bexarotene, are drugs related to vitamin A that can slow the growth of certain types of cancer cells. The retinoids may be taken by mouth or put on the skin.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Interferon is a type of biologic therapy used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. It interferes with the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy and other types of targeted therapies are used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome.     Alemtuzumab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    Other types of monoclonal antibody therapy are being studied in clinical trials to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome.      Vorinostat and romidepsin are two of the histone deacetylase (HDAC) inhibitors used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. HDAC inhibitors cause a chemical change that stops tumor cells from dividing.     Pralatrexate is a dihydrofolate reductase (DHFR) inhibitor used to treat mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome. It builds up in cancer cells and stops them from using folate, a nutrient needed for cells to divide. Pralatrexate may slow the growth of tumors and kill cancer cells.     See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information. (Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome are types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.)
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy and radiation therapy with stem cell transplant    This treatment is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and radiation therapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow or blood of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
                
                
                    Treatment for mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

1. **PUVA therapy**: This involves the use of psoralen and ultraviolet A light to treat skin symptoms and can help improve the quality of life by reducing skin rashes and discomfort.

2. **Systemic chemotherapy or biologic therapy**: These treatments can support the management of symptoms and help control the progression of the disease.

3. **Extracorporeal photochemotherapy**: This method allows for more targeted treatment of affected skin cells while aiming to minimize systemic exposure.

4. **Radiation therapy**: Radiation can be used palliatively to relieve symptoms, control localized disease, and improve quality of life by addressing painful tumors or skin manifestations.

5. **Topical corticosteroid therapy and retinoid therapy**: These can relieve skin symptoms like itching, inflammation, and redness.

6. **Systemic chemotherapy**: This can control disease progression and alleviate symptoms associated with widespread cancer activity.

7. **Targeted therapy**: Use of drugs that target specific cancer cells can also help manage the condition more effectively.

The primary aim of these treatments is to alleviate symptoms, improve the patient's comfort, and enhance their overall quality of life as the disease is generally more challenging to cure at this advanced stage. Clinical trials might also be considered for access to new and potentially effective treatments.",501,"What palliative care strategies are recommended for stage IV mycosis fungoides or Szary syndrome, and how do these treatments aim to improve quality of life?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely mirrors the original answer by outlining the palliative care strategies recommended for stage IV mycosis fungoides and Szary syndrome.

"Tests that examine the lungs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage non-small cell lung cancer are often done at the same time. Some of the following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken.    -   Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.    -  Chest x-ray: An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Sputum cytology : A procedure in which a pathologist views a sample of sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) under a microscope, to check for cancer cells.    -   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung: The removal of tissue or fluid from the lung using a thin needle. A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to locate the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.    -   Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Thoracoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes cant be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.     -   Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.    -   Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.    -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.","Bronchoscopy and thoracoscopy are both procedures used to diagnose lung cancer but have different applications and approaches.

**Bronchoscopy**:
- **Purpose**: It is primarily used to visualize the trachea and large airways of the lungs to identify abnormal areas and can also allow for the collection of tissue samples (biopsy).
- **Procedure**: A bronchoscope, which is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and lens, is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs to inspect and potentially collect samples.
- **Typical Use**: Bronchoscopy is generally employed when there is a need to investigate symptoms such as persistent cough or unexplained lung abnormalities detected in imaging tests.

**Thoracoscopy**:
- **Purpose**: This procedure is utilized to examine the organs inside the chest and to check for abnormal areas. It can also involve the collection of tissue or lymph node samples.
- **Procedure**: In thoracoscopy, a thoracoscope is inserted through an incision between the ribs to look inside the chest cavity. This procedure can be more invasive and may also involve removal of lung tissue if necessary.

"Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

1. **Participant Background**: Some cancer prevention trials are conducted specifically with individuals who have previously had cancer, particularly those trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chances of developing a new type of cancer. In contrast, trials involving healthy participants focus on those who have not had cancer but may have an increased risk for it.

2. **Objectives**: The trials for individuals with a history of cancer often aim to evaluate strategies for preventing recurrence or new cancer development, while studies with healthy participants aim to assess ways to lower cancer risk through lifestyle changes, medications, or dietary interventions.

3. **Risk Factors**: Trials involving survivors may take into account the specific risk factors that apply to these individuals, such as prior cancer treatments or genetic predispositions that might influence their risk for endometrial cancer. Healthy participants may not have these same risk factors, and their assessment focuses more broadly on population-level risk factors.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) is affected by certain factors before and after treatment.    The prognosis of untreated osteosarcoma and MFH depends on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the body and whether tumors formed in more than one bone.    - The size of the tumor.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and where it has spread.    - The type of tumor (based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope).    - The patient's age and weight at diagnosis.    - Whether the tumor has caused a break in the bone.     - Whether the patient has certain genetic diseases.        After osteosarcoma or MFH is treated, prognosis also depends on the following:         - How much of the cancer was killed by chemotherapy.    - How much of the tumor was taken out by surgery.    - Whether chemotherapy is delayed for more than 3 weeks after surgery takes place.    - Whether the cancer has recurred (come back) within 2 years of diagnosis.        Treatment options for osteosarcoma and MFH depend on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the body.    - The size of the tumor.    - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether the bones are still growing.    - The patient's age and general health.    - The desire of the patient and family for the patient to be able to participate in activities such as sports or have a certain appearance.    - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred after treatment.","The location of the tumor is a significant factor that affects both prognosis and treatment choices for Osteosarcoma and Malignant Fibrous Histiocytoma (MFH) of Bone. 

**Prognosis:**
1. The prognosis for both Osteosarcoma and MFH is influenced by where the tumor is located in the body, as well as whether tumors have formed in more than one bone. This indicates that certain locations may be associated with a better or worse chance of recovery.
2. The size of the tumor and whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body, including where it has spread, are also impacted by the tumor's location, thereby influencing prognosis.

**Treatment Choices:**
1. Treatment options depend on several factors, prominently including the location of the tumor. Different sites may require different surgical approaches and adjuvant therapies.
2. For localized tumors, surgery is often the first line of treatment, sometimes followed by chemotherapy; however, if the tumor cannot be completely removed, radiation therapy may also be incorporated into the treatment plan.
3. If the cancer has metastasized (spread), treatment typically entails a combination of chemotherapy and surgery to address both the primary tumor and any metastatic sites, which can vary substantially based on where the tumors are located.

Overall, recognizing the tumor's location is crucial in tailoring treatment plans and predicting outcomes for patients with Osteosarcoma and MFH.",92,How does the location of the tumor relate to both prognosis and treatment choices for these types of bone cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding the relationship between tumor location, prognosis, and treatment choices for osteosarcoma and MFH.

                    Renal cell cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in tubules of the kidney.
                    Renal cell cancer (also called kidney cancer or renal adenocarcinoma) is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the lining of tubules (very small tubes) in the kidney. There are 2 kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. They take out waste products and make urine. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the urethra and leaves the body.     Cancer that starts in the ureters or the renal pelvis (the part of the kidney that collects urine and drains it to the ureters) is different from renal cell cancer. (See the PDQ summary about Transitional Cell Cancer of the Renal Pelvis and Ureter Treatment for more information).","The primary factors that can influence the risk of developing renal cell cancer, particularly regarding lifestyle choices, include:

1. **Smoking:** Smoking is noted as a significant risk factor.
2. **Misuse of pain medications:** The misuse of certain pain medicines can also affect the risk of renal cell cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery to remove the tumor is the primary treatment of all stages of melanoma. A wide local excision is used to remove the melanoma and some of the normal tissue around it. Skin grafting (taking skin from another part of the body to replace the skin that is removed) may be done to cover the wound caused by surgery.     It is important to know whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy are done to check for cancer in the sentinel lymph node (the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor) during surgery. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, more lymph nodes will be removed and tissue samples will be checked for signs of cancer. This is called a lymphadenectomy.    Even if the doctor removes all the melanoma that can be seen at the time of surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, lung, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone, or brain may be done to improve the patients quality of life by controlling symptoms.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).    One type of regional chemotherapy is hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion. With this method, anticancer drugs go directly to the arm or leg the cancer is in. The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet. A warm solution with the anticancer drug is put directly into the blood of the limb. This gives a high dose of drugs to the area where the cancer is.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat melanoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biologic therapy.     The following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of melanoma:            -  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Some types of immune cells, such as T cells, and some cancer cells have certain proteins, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased. They are used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. There are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:                  -  CTLA-4 inhibitor: CTL4-A is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.       -  PD-1 inhibitor: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are types of PD-1 inhibitors.                -  Interferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.     -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2): IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.     -  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy: TNF is a protein made by white blood cells in response to an antigen or infection. TNF is made in the laboratory and used as a treatment to kill cancer cells. It is being studied in the treatment of melanoma.           See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. The following types of targeted therapy are used or being studied in the treatment of melanoma:             -  Signal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.                   -  Vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, and cobimetinib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib block the activity of proteins made by mutant BRAF genes. Trametinib and cobimetinib affect the growth and survival of cancer cells.                -  Oncolytic virus therapy: A type of targeted therapy that is used in the treatment of melanoma. Oncolytic virus therapy uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given after oncolytic virus therapy to kill more cancer cells.      -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: A type of targeted therapy that is being studied in the treatment of melanoma. Angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new blood vessels. In cancer treatment, they may be given to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.            New targeted therapies and combinations of therapies are being studied in the treatment of melanoma.    See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Here are the primary treatments and their possible side effects:

1. **Surgery**: 
   - May lead to pain, scarring, and complications such as infections.
   - If lymph nodes are removed, there may be long-term lymphedema (swelling due to lymph fluid accumulation).

2. **Chemotherapy**: 
   - Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, hair loss, fatigue, and an increased risk of infections due to lowered white blood cell counts.

3. **Radiation Therapy**: 
   - Possible side effects include skin irritation, fatigue, and localized pain. It may also cause long-term damage to nearby tissues.

4. **Immunotherapy**: 
   - Side effects can include flu-like symptoms, skin rashes, fatigue, and inflammation of organs (such as lungs or liver) which could impact overall health.

5. **Targeted Therapy**: 
   - Side effects may be less severe than traditional chemotherapy but can include skin rashes, diarrhea, and effects on liver function.

The cause of most childhood CNS germ cell tumors is not known.,"Children diagnosed with central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors have several treatment options available, which are planned by a team of healthcare providers who specialize in treating cancer in children. The main treatment modalities include:

1. **Radiation Therapy**: This involves using high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy used:
   - **External Radiation Therapy**: A machine outside the body sends radiation toward the tumor.
   - **Internal Radiation Therapy**: A radioactive substance is placed directly into or near the tumor.

2. **Chemotherapy**: This treatment uses drugs to inhibit the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or stopping them from dividing. When administered, chemotherapy can be systemic (affecting the whole body) or regional (targeted to a specific area).

3. **Surgery**: Depending on the tumor's location within the brain, surgery may be performed to remove the tumor. In some cases, additional treatments such as chemotherapy or radiation therapy may follow surgery to tackle any remaining cancer cells.

4. **High-Dose Chemotherapy with Stem Cell Rescue**: This approach administers high doses of chemotherapy accompanied by the transplantation of stem cells to restore the blood-forming cells lost during treatment.

In addition to these standard treatments, new therapies are being tested in clinical trials, which children with CNS germ cell tumors may consider participating in. Regular follow-up tests will also be needed to monitor the effectiveness of the treatment and any changes in the child's condition.",445,"What current treatments are available for children diagnosed with CNS germ cell tumors, particularly given that their causes remain largely unknown?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides detailed information about treatments for CNS germ cell tumors, which is related to the context of the generated question.

"Imaging and blood tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose extragonadal germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. The testicles may be checked for lumps, swelling, or pain. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following three tumor markers are used to detect extragonadal germ cell tumor:                -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Blood levels of the tumor markers help determine if the tumor is a seminoma or nonseminoma.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. Sometimes a CT scan and a PET scan are done at the same time. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. When a PET scan and CT scan are done at the same time, it is called a PET-CT.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The type of biopsy used depends on where the extragonadal germ cell tumor is found.                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.      -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or sample of tissue.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.","During the physical exam for diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors, a physician might look for specific signs of disease, which include:

- Checking for **breathing problems** and **chest pain**.
- Examining for **lumps** or any abnormalities in the body, especially in areas where the tumors are likely to form, such as the **mediastinum** or **retroperitoneum**.
- Observing for any signs of **swelling** or **unusual pain** in the abdomen or chest, as these may indicate tumor presence.

Additionally, the physician may assess general signs of health, which could include evaluating other symptoms like **cough**, **fever**, **headache**, **fatigue**, **change in bowel habits**, and **visual disturbances** that might suggest tumor impact.",19,What specific signs of disease might a physician look for during the physical exam when diagnosing extragonadal germ cell tumors?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides some information that relates to the original answer, particularly regarding the physical exam and the search for lumps or abnormalities.

"The following tests and procedures may be used to detect (find) and diagnose LCH or conditions caused by LCH:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a person's mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      -  The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.       - The number and type of white blood cells.      - The number of red blood cells and platelets.             -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the body by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Liver function test : A blood test to measure the blood levels of certain substances released by the liver. A high or low level of these substances can be a sign of disease in the liver.    -   BRAF gene testing : A laboratory test in which a sample of blood or tissue is tested for mutations of the BRAF gene.    -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, red blood cells, and white blood cells.     -   Water deprivation test : A test to check how much urine is made and whether it becomes concentrated when little or no water is given. This test is used to diagnose diabetes insipidus, which may be caused by LCH.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow and bone under a microscope to look for signs of LCH.  The following tests may be done on the tissue that was removed:               -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.       -  Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, how many cells are live, and the size of the cells. It also shows the shapes of the cells and whether there are tumor markers on the surface of the cells. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light.              -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.     -   X-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. Sometimes a skeletal survey is done. This is a procedure to x-ray all of the bones in the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium may be injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the LCH cells so that they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for LCH cells. To diagnose LCH, a biopsy of bone lesions, skin, lymph nodes, or the liver may be done.","A doctor may opt for a bronchoscopy or endoscopy during the diagnostic process for Langerhans Cell Histiocytosis (LCH) in scenarios involving suspected pulmonary involvement or gastrointestinal manifestations of the disease. These procedures allow for direct visualization and sampling of tissues in the lungs or gastrointestinal tract, which can help in confirming a diagnosis or assessing the extent of LCH lesions in these areas.",543,In what scenarios would a doctor opt for a bronchoscopy or endoscopy during the diagnostic process for LCH?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the use of bronchoscopy and endoscopy in the diagnostic process for LCH, which is a subset of the extensive list of tests and procedures provided in the original answer.

                    After lip and oral cavity cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lip and oral cavity or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lip and oral cavity or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose lip and oral cavity cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if lip cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually lip cancer cells. The disease is metastatic lip cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for lip and oral cavity cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the lips and oral cavity. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.        Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters, and cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.       Stage III    In stage III, the tumor:            - may be any size and has spread to one lymph node that is 3 centimeters or smaller, on the same side of the neck as the tumor; or     - is larger than 4 centimeters.              Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.            - In stage IVA, the tumor:                  - has spread through tissue in the lip or oral cavity into nearby tissue and/or bone (jaw, tongue, floor of mouth, maxillary sinus, or skin on the chin or nose); cancer may have spread to one lymph node that is 3 centimeters or smaller, on the same side of the neck as the tumor; or       -  is any size or has spread through tissue in the lip or oral cavity into nearby tissue and/or bone (jaw, tongue, floor of mouth, maxillary sinus, or skin on the chin or nose), and cancer has spread:                           -  to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters; or          - to more than one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; or          - to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the neck as the tumor or on both sides of the neck, and the lymph nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters.                                  - In stage IVB, the tumor:                  - may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters; or       - has spread further into the muscles or bones in the oral cavity, or to the base of the skull and/or the carotid artery. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck.                 - In stage IVC, the tumor has spread beyond the lip or oral cavity to distant parts of the body, such as the lungs. The tumor may be any size and may have spread to the lymph nodes.","Stage IV lip and oral cavity cancer is differentiated into three subcategories (IVA, IVB, and IVC) based on the extent of tissue invasion and lymph node involvement:

- **Stage IVA**:
  - The tumor has invaded nearby tissue and/or bone in the lip or oral cavity (e.g., jaw, tongue, floor of mouth, maxillary sinus, or skin on the chin or nose).
  - Cancer may have spread to one lymph node that is 3 centimeters or smaller on the same side of the neck as the tumor.
  - Alternatively, it can be any size with more extensive invasion through tissue and/or bone, with specific lymph node involvement, including:
    - One lymph node on the same side, larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters.
    - More than one lymph node on the same side, with all being not larger than 6 centimeters.
    - Involvement of lymph nodes on the opposite side of the neck or on both sides, all not larger than 6 centimeters.

- **Stage IVB**:
  - The tumor can be any size but has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters.
  - It may also have spread further into muscles or bones in the oral cavity, or to the base of the skull and/or carotid artery.
  - Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck.

- **Stage IVC**:
  - The tumor has metastasized beyond the lip or oral cavity to distant parts of the body (e.g., lungs), and the tumor size and lymph node involvement can be any size.

                    Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.   There are two general types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)     Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)
                
                
                    There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    The two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are:         -  Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.    -  Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.        Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes, based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope:         - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma.","The components of the lymphatic system, including lymph nodes and the spleen, play critical roles in the development and progression of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. Hodgkin lymphoma is characterized by the formation of malignant cells in the lymphatic system, which is integral to the body's immune function.

1. **Lymph Nodes**: These small, bean-shaped structures filter lymph fluid and store lymphocytes, which are white blood cells that help fight infections and diseases. In childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, the cancer often manifests as swollen lymph nodes, commonly in areas such as the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin. The lymph nodes can represent the primary sites where cancer spreads, and their involvement is key in determining the cancer stage.

2. **Spleen**: The spleen is involved in the production of lymphocytes, filtering blood, and managing blood cell turnover. In Hodgkin lymphoma, cancer can spread to the spleen, which is significant for staging the disease. The presence of cancer in the spleen (designated as Stage S) indicates a more advanced disease and can influence treatment decisions.

Overall, the lymphatic system's components are central to both the manifestation and the staging of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, impacting how the disease develops and progresses.",362,"What important roles do the lymph system components, such as lymph nodes and the spleen, play in the development and progression of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the roles of lymph nodes and the spleen in the context of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, which relates to the original answers that mention these components. However, it does not address all key points from the original answers, such as the types of Hodgkin lymphoma, associated risks like Epstein-Barr virus infection, symptoms, diagnostic tests, and prognosis factors. Therefore, while there is relevance, it is not fully aligned with the comprehensive information presented in the original answer."
"Smoking is the major risk factor for non-small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer.    Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:            -  Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.      -  Being exposed to secondhand smoke.     - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following:                  -  Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.       -  Radon in the home or workplace.       -  Imaging tests such as CT scans.       - Atomic bomb radiation.                 -  Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace.     -  Living where there is air pollution.     -  Having a family history of lung cancer.     -  Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).     -  Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.     When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.","The context does not provide specific information about how the age of onset and duration of smoking affect the likelihood of lung cancer diagnosis in individuals. However, it is noted that smoking is a significant risk factor for lung cancer, with the risk increasing with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the duration of smoking. Therefore, while the context does not explicitly answer the question regarding age of onset and its relationship with smoking and lung cancer diagnosis, it can be inferred that longer duration and possibly earlier onset of smoking increase the likelihood of lung cancer.",1,How does the age of onset and duration of smoking affect the likelihood of lung cancer diagnosis in individuals?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer acknowledges the significance of smoking as a risk factor for lung cancer and addresses the implications of smoking duration and frequency. However, it does not directly answer the specific question about the age of onset, although it implies a connection. Therefore, it is partially relevant but lacks a direct response to the inquiry."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:          -  Whether the patient has HPV infection of the oropharynx.    - Whether the patient has a history of smoking cigarettes for ten or more pack years.     -  The stage of the cancer.    -  The number and size of lymph nodes with cancer.        Oropharyngeal tumors related to HPV infection have a better prognosis and are less likely to recur than tumors not linked to HPV infection.   Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Keeping the patient's ability to speak and swallow as normal as possible.    - The patient's general health.        Patients with oropharyngeal cancer have an increased risk of another cancer in the head or neck. This risk is increased in patients who continue to smoke or drink alcohol after treatment.   See the PDQ summary Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit for more information.,"The stage of oropharyngeal cancer and the characteristics of lymph nodes significantly influence treatment options and expected recovery outcomes. 

1. **Staging**: Oropharyngeal cancer is categorized into stages (Stage 0 to Stage IV), which determines the extent of cancer spread. For instance,
   - **Stage I and II** are typically localized cancers, where treatment may include surgery or radiation therapy.
   - **Stage III and IV** involve more extensive disease, often requiring a combination of surgery, radiation, and chemotherapy, particularly if cancer has spread to lymph nodes or other structures.

2. **Lymph Node Characteristics**: 
   - In Stage III, cancer can spread to a single lymph node on the same side of the neck that is 3 cm or smaller, affecting treatment decisions.
   - For Stage IV (subdivided into IVA, IVB, and IVC), more lymph nodes may be involved, and their size impacts the treatment approach. Treatment becomes more aggressive with larger or multiple lymph node involvement.

3. **Prognosis**: The number and size of lymph nodes with cancer also affect the prognosis. For instance, oropharyngeal tumors associated with HPV infection tend to have a better prognosis compared to those that are not.

Overall, the stage of the cancer and lymph node involvement guide the treatment strategy, which can range from surgical procedures to chemotherapy and radiation, impacting both the effectiveness of treatment and the likelihood of recovery.",331,In what ways do the stage of oropharyngeal cancer and the characteristics of lymph nodes affect treatment options and expected recovery outcomes?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the factors affecting treatment options and expected recovery outcomes as outlined in the original answer. It elaborates on the staging of oropharyngeal cancer and the characteristics of lymph nodes, matching the original discussion on how these factors influence prognosis and treatment decisions, including the impact of HPV infection on recovery outcomes."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the nasopharynx, involves the whole nasopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body).     - The type of nasopharyngeal cancer.     - The size of the tumor.    - The patients age and general health.","The size of the tumor and the type of nasopharyngeal cancer significantly affect the recovery chances for a patient. Specifically:

1. **Size of the Tumor**: The prognosis (chance of recovery) is influenced by the size of the tumor. Larger tumors may indicate more advanced disease and can lead to a poorer prognosis.

2. **Type of Nasopharyngeal Cancer**: Different types of nasopharyngeal cancer have varying implications for treatment options and overall prognosis. Each type may respond differently to treatment, impacting the recovery chances.

Both factors are critical in determining the stage of the cancer, which is vital for planning treatment and assessing recovery potential.",259,In what ways do the size of the tumor and the type of nasopharyngeal cancer affect the recovery chances for a patient?,RELEVANT,The generated answer directly addresses the factors mentioned in the original answer (size of the tumor and type of nasopharyngeal cancer) and explains their impact on prognosis and treatment options. It closely aligns with the context of the original answer while providing detailed information about how each factor influences recovery chances.
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Where the tumor is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the cancer has spread to blood vessels.        For patients who smoke, the chance of recovery is better if they stop smoking before beginning radiation therapy.   Treatment options depend on the following:          - The stage of the cancer.    - The size of the tumor and where it is in the lip or oral cavity.    - Whether the patient's appearance and ability to talk and eat can stay the same.    - The patient's age and general health.        Patients who have had lip and oral cavity cancer have an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important. Clinical trials are studying the use of retinoid drugs to reduce the risk of a second head and neck cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","The location of the tumor within the lip or oral cavity significantly influences treatment decisions and expected outcomes. Each area in the lip and oral cavity has specific treatment protocols based on the stage and location of the cancer:

1. **Lip**: For cancer in the lip, treatments often involve surgery (wide local excision) and may include radiation therapy (internal and/or external). 

2. **Front of the Tongue**: Treatment for cancer in this area may involve surgery and radiation therapy, and in some cases, chemotherapy trials before or after surgery.

3. **Buccal Mucosa**: For tumors located in the buccal mucosa, treatments can range from surgery for smaller tumors to radiation therapy for larger ones.

4. **Floor of the Mouth**: Similar to the buccal mucosa, treatment options vary by tumor size but typically involve surgery and possibly radiation therapy.

5. **Lower Gingiva**: Treatment may include surgery that might require removal of part of the jawbone, along with radiation therapy as needed.

6. **Retromolar Trigone**: This area may require more extensive surgery that includes lymph nodes and part of the jaw.

7. **Upper Gingiva or Hard Palate**: Treatment usually involves surgery with or without radiation therapy.

The expected outcomes are also affected by these locations. For instance, cancers that invade deeper tissues or are located where significant functional structures (like the tongue or jaw) are involved might lead to more complex treatment scenarios and potentially poorer outcomes, particularly if they are diagnosed at a later stage (Stages III and IV). Moreover, treatment decisions are also influenced by the cancer's stage, size, and whether it has spread to lymph nodes or other tissues. Overall, precise tumor location plays a crucial role in tailoring therapy and prognostication.",393,How does the location of the tumor within the lip or oral cavity influence the treatment decisions and expected outcomes?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the influence of tumor location within the lip or oral cavity on treatment decisions and expected outcomes, echoing the points made in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the neck and blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose parathyroid cancer. Once blood tests are done and hyperparathyroidism is diagnosed, imaging tests may be done to help find which of the parathyroid glands is overactive. Sometimes the parathyroid glands are hard to find and imaging tests are done to find exactly where they are.   Parathyroid cancer may be hard to diagnose because the cells of a benign parathyroid adenoma and a malignant parathyroid cancer look alike. The patient's symptoms, blood levels of calcium and parathyroid hormone, and characteristics of the tumor are also used to make a diagnosis.    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. To diagnose parathyroid cancer, the sample of blood is checked for its calcium level.     -   Parathyroid hormone test: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of parathyroid hormone released into the blood by the parathyroid glands. A higher than normal amount of parathyroid hormone can be a sign of disease.    -   Sestamibi scan : A type of radionuclide scan used to find an overactive parathyroid gland. A very small amount of a radioactive substance called technetium 99 is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream to the parathyroid gland. The radioactive substance will collect in the overactive gland and show up brightly on a special camera that detects radioactivity.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the neck and takes pictures. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Angiogram : A procedure to look at blood vessels and the flow of blood. A contrast dye is injected into the blood vessel. As the contrast dye moves through the blood vessel, x-rays are taken to see if there are any blockages.    -   Venous sampling : A procedure in which a sample of blood is taken from specific veins and checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by nearby organs and tissues. If imaging tests do not show which parathyroid gland is overactive, blood samples may be taken from veins near each parathyroid gland to find which one is making too much PTH.","The commonly used imaging tests to locate overactive parathyroid glands during the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer include:

1. **Sestamibi scan**: This is a radionuclide scan that uses a radioactive substance, technetium 99, which is injected into a vein. It travels through the bloodstream and collects in the overactive parathyroid gland, allowing it to be identified on a special camera.

2. **CT scan (CAT scan)**: This procedure creates a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body from different angles, often using dye to help visualize organs or tissues more clearly.

3. **SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan)**: This scan involves injecting a small amount of radioactive substance into a vein, which travels through the blood. A special camera then takes 3-dimensional images, highlighting areas of higher blood flow and metabolism indicative of cancer cells.

4. **Ultrasound exam**: This test utilizes high-energy sound waves to create a live image of the inside of the body, providing real-time images of the parathyroid glands.

These imaging tests are performed after blood tests confirm the presence of hyperparathyroidism to help identify which parathyroid gland is overactive.",130,What types of imaging tests are commonly used to locate overactive parathyroid glands during the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about imaging tests used to locate overactive parathyroid glands during the diagnosis of parathyroid cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with endometrial cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with endometrial cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for endometrial cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:             -  Total hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.     -  Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.     -  Radical hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus, cervix, and part of the vagina. The ovaries, fallopian tubes, or nearby lymph nodes may also be removed.     -  Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or hormone treatment after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.        Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat endometrial cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.
                
                
                    Targeted therapy
                    Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibodies, mTOR inhibitors, and signal transduction inhibitors are three types of targeted therapy used to treat endometrial cancer.         - Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Bevacizumab is used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.    - mTOR inhibitors block a protein called mTOR, which helps control cell division. mTOR inhibitors may keep cancer cells from growing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Everolimus and ridaforalimus are used to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.    - Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Metformin is being studied to treat stage III, stage IV, and recurrent endometrial cancer.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Tests and procedures to stage gallbladder cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
                    See the General Information section for a description of tests and procedures used to detect, diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if gallbladder cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually gallbladder cancer cells. The disease is metastatic gallbladder cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for gallbladder cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the inner (mucosal) layer of the gallbladder. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and has spread beyond the inner (mucosal) layer to a layer of tissue with blood vessels or to the muscle layer.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread beyond the muscle layer to the connective tissue around the muscle.       Stage IIIA    In stage IIIA, cancer has spread through the thin layers of tissue that cover the gallbladder and/or to the liver and/or to one nearby organ (such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bile ducts outside the liver).       Stage IIIB    In stage IIIB, cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and:            -  beyond the inner layer of the gallbladder to a layer of tissue with blood vessels or to the muscle layer; or     -  beyond the muscle layer to the connective tissue around the muscle; or     - through the thin layers of tissue that cover the gallbladder and/or to the liver and/or to one nearby organ (such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bile ducts outside the liver).              Stage IVA    In stage IVA, cancer has spread to a main blood vessel of the liver or to 2 or more nearby organs or areas other than the liver. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.       Stage IVB    In stage IVB, cancer has spread to either:            -  lymph nodes along large arteries in the abdomen and/or near the lower part of the backbone; or      - to organs or areas far away from the gallbladder.
                
                
                    For gallbladder cancer, stages are also grouped according to how the cancer may be treated. There are two treatment groups:
                    Localized (Stage I)      Cancer is found in the wall of the gallbladder and can be completely removed by surgery.        Unresectable, recurrent, or metastatic (Stage II, Stage III, and Stage IV)     Unresectable cancer cannot be removed completely by surgery. Most patients with gallbladder cancer have unresectable cancer.      Recurrent cancer is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. Gallbladder cancer may come back in the gallbladder or in other parts of the body.     Metastasis is the spread of cancer from the primary site (place where it started) to other places in the body. Metastatic gallbladder cancer may spread to surrounding tissues, organs, throughout the abdominal cavity, or to distant parts of the body.","In Stage IIIB gallbladder cancer, the cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and can also exhibit one or more of the following characteristics:

- It has spread beyond the inner layer of the gallbladder to a layer of tissue with blood vessels or to the muscle layer.
- It has spread beyond the muscle layer to the connective tissue around the muscle.
- It may have spread through the thin layers of tissue that cover the gallbladder and/or to the liver and/or to one nearby organ such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, pancreas, or bile ducts outside the liver.",252,What are the specific characteristics of Stage IIIB gallbladder cancer in relation to nearby lymph nodes and surrounding tissues?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the specific characteristics of Stage IIIB gallbladder cancer as outlined in the original answer.

                    Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
                    The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the bodys cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger and has three lobes. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also involved in lung cancer. Tiny air sacs called alveoli and small tubes called bronchioles make up the inside of the lungs.     A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outside of each lung and lines the inside wall of the chest cavity. This creates a sac called the pleural cavity. The pleural cavity normally contains a small amount of fluid that helps the lungs move smoothly in the chest when you breathe.    There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information about lung cancer:         -  Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment     -  Lung Cancer Prevention     -  Lung Cancer Screening
                
                
                    There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer.
                    Each type of non-small cell lung cancer has different kinds of cancer cells. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of non-small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look under a microscope:         -  Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that begins in squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales. This is also called epidermoid carcinoma.    -  Large cell carcinoma: Cancer that may begin in several types of large cells.    -  Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that begins in the cells that line the alveoli and make substances such as mucus.         Other less common types of non-small cell lung cancer are: pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma.
                
                
                    For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
                    If lung cancer is found, taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","Common symptoms that may indicate the presence of non-small cell lung cancer, particularly regarding persistent respiratory issues, include:

- A cough that doesn't go away or gets worse over time.
- Shortness of breath.
- Chest discomfort or pain.
- Wheezing.
- Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).
- Trouble breathing. 

These symptoms may arise from non-small cell lung cancer or other conditions, so it is advisable to consult a doctor if experiencing any of these signs.",0,"What are the common symptoms that may indicate the presence of non-small cell lung cancer, particularly regarding persistent respiratory issues?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the symptoms of non-small cell lung cancer, which aligns with the original answer's mention of signs including a persistent cough and shortness of breath.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with thymoma and thymic carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to remove the tumor is the most common treatment of thymoma.     Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat thymoma and thymic carcinoma.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy may be used to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.       Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances produced by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.    Hormone therapy with drugs called corticosteroids may be used to treat thymoma or thymic carcinoma.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

**Stage I and II:**
- **Stage I**: The only treatment recommended is surgery to remove the tumor.
- **Stage II**: Treatment consists of surgery followed by radiation therapy. This approach aims to eliminate any remaining cancer cells after the tumor has been surgically removed.

**Stage III and IV:**
- For **Stage III** thymomas that may be completely removed, treatment options include:
  - Surgery with or without radiation therapy.
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy (chemotherapy given before surgery) followed by surgery with or without radiation therapy.
  - Participation in clinical trials testing new combinations or doses of anticancer drugs or innovative radiation therapy techniques.

- For **Stage III and IV** thymomas that cannot be completely removed, the treatment options include:
  - Neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by surgery and/or radiation therapy.
  - Radiation therapy.
  - Chemotherapy.
  - Participation in clinical trials for new drug combinations or radiation delivery methods.

Overall, the main difference in the treatment approach between stages I and II compared to stages III and IV lies in the complexity of care, incorporating chemotherapy and potential clinical trials for advanced stages, while earlier stages rely primarily on surgical intervention with a subsequent radiation therapy.",597,"What standard treatments are recommended for patients diagnosed with thymoma, and how does the approach differ for stages I and II compared to stages III and IV?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the standard treatments for thymoma, clearly differentiating the approaches for stages I and II compared to stages III and IV, which aligns well with the detailed information provided in the original answer.

                    Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.
                    Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine.      The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue.          -  Mucosal (inner) layer.    - Muscularis (middle, muscle) layer.     -  Serosal (outer) layer.        Between these layers is supporting connective tissue. Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the inner layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.
                
                
                    Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.
                    Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:         - There are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer.    - The symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses.    - The gallbladder is hidden behind the liver.         Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. Patients with gallstones rarely develop gallbladder cancer.","Yes, being female can significantly influence the likelihood of developing gallbladder cancer, as it is noted to be a risk factor. Additionally, being Native American is also mentioned as another risk factor for gallbladder cancer. Risk factors are factors that increase the chance of developing a disease, but having a risk factor does not mean that one will develop cancer, nor does the absence of risk factors guarantee someone will not develop it.",247,"Can being female significantly influence the likelihood of developing gallbladder cancer, and are there other risk factors to consider?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the influence of being female on the likelihood of developing gallbladder cancer, which is a key point from the original answer. However, it also introduces additional information about being Native American as another risk factor, which is not mentioned in the original answer. While the generated answer maintains some relevance by discussing risk factors, the lack of comprehensive alignment with the original content and focus on other factors causes it to be classified as partly relevant rather than fully relevant."
Diet and health history can affect the risk of developing small intestine cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for small intestine cancer include the following:         - Eating a high-fat diet.    - Having Crohn disease.     - Having celiac disease.    -  Having familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP).,"Familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) is a recognized risk factor for small intestine cancer. Individuals with FAP have a genetic predisposition that increases their likelihood of developing polyps in the colon and rectum, which can lead to colorectal cancer. This hereditary condition also raises the risk for other types of cancer, including small intestine cancer, although the exact mechanisms and the degree of risk enhancement associated with FAP are not specified in the provided context. It's important for individuals with FAP to discuss their risk with a healthcare provider to initiate appropriate monitoring and early intervention strategies.",264,What role does familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) play in the risk factors associated with small intestine cancer?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer does correctly identify familial adenomatous polyposis (FAP) as a risk factor for small intestine cancer, aligning with the original answer. However, it also focuses more on the implications of FAP in relation to colorectal cancer and the genetic predisposition aspect, which, while relevant, diverts slightly from the original context that primarily discusses risk factors directly associated with small intestine cancer without elaborating on colorectal cancer. Therefore, the answer is relevant but does not fully address the specific context of small intestine cancer as requested."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Age of the child at the time of diagnosis.    - The child's risk group.    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes.    - Where in the body the tumor started.    - Tumor histology (the shape, function, and structure of the tumor cells).    - Whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes on the same side of the body as the primary cancer or whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes on the opposite side of the body.    - How the tumor responds to treatment.    - How much time passed between diagnosis and when the cancer recurred (for recurrent cancer).        Prognosis and treatment options for neuroblastoma are also affected by tumor biology, which includes:          - The patterns of the tumor cells.    - How different the tumor cells are from normal cells.    - How fast the tumor cells are growing.    - Whether the tumor shows MYCN amplification.    - Whether the tumor has changes in the ALK gene.         The tumor biology is said to be favorable or unfavorable, depending on these factors. A favorable tumor biology means there is a better chance of recovery.   In some children up to 6 months old, neuroblastoma may disappear without treatment. This is called spontaneous regression. The child is closely watched for signs or symptoms of neuroblastoma. If signs or symptoms occur, treatment may be needed.","The risk group classification for neuroblastoma significantly impacts expected recovery outcomes. There are three recognized risk groups: low risk, intermediate risk, and high risk. 

- **Low-risk and intermediate-risk neuroblastoma have a good chance of being cured.** This implies that children in these categories tend to have more favorable treatment responses and prognosis.
- **High-risk neuroblastoma may be hard to cure.** Patients classified under this category often face more challenging treatment options and generally poorer prognosis compared to those in the lower risk groups.

Additionally, factors such as the age of the child at diagnosis, the specific characteristics of the tumor, and its biological behavior also influence recovery outcomes within these risk classifications.",123,How does the risk group classification for Neuroblastoma impact the expected recovery outcomes?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely aligns with the original answer by addressing how the risk group classification affects expected recovery outcomes in neuroblastoma.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with laryngeal cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with laryngeal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells. There are two types of radiation therapy. External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.        Radiation therapy may work better in patients who have stopped smoking before beginning treatment. External radiation therapy to the thyroid or the pituitary gland may change the way the thyroid gland works. The doctor may test the thyroid gland before and after therapy to make sure it is working properly.      Hyperfractionated radiation therapy and new types of radiation therapy are being studied in the treatment of laryngeal cancer.       Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is a common treatment for all stages of laryngeal cancer. The following surgical procedures may be used:            -  Cordectomy: Surgery to remove the vocal cords only.     -  Supraglottic laryngectomy: Surgery to remove the supraglottis only.      -  Hemilaryngectomy: Surgery to remove half of the larynx (voice box). A hemilaryngectomy saves the voice.     -  Partial laryngectomy: Surgery to remove part of the larynx (voice box). A partial laryngectomy helps keep the patient's ability to talk.     -  Total laryngectomy: Surgery to remove the whole larynx. During this operation, a hole is made in the front of the neck to allow the patient to breathe. This is called a tracheostomy.     -  Thyroidectomy: The removal of all or part of the thyroid gland.     -  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.     See Drugs Approved for Head and Neck Cancer for more information. (Laryngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.)
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI Web site.     Chemoprevention     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other substances to reduce the risk of developing cancer or to reduce the risk cancer will recur (come back). The drug isotretinoin is being studied to prevent the development of a second cancer in patients who have had cancer of the head or neck.        Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.

Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

**Potential Benefits:**
1. **Access to New Treatments:** Patients may receive new therapies that are not yet available as standard treatments, which could be more effective than current options.
2. **Contribution to Research:** Participation helps advance cancer treatment knowledge and can lead to improved treatments for future patients.
3. **Enhanced Monitoring:** Clinical trials often include increased monitoring and follow-up care, allowing for close observation of health and side effects.
4. **Possibility of Standard Treatment:** Patients might receive the standard treatment combined with new therapeutic approaches that could be beneficial.

**Considerations:**
1. **Eligibility Restrictions:** Some trials may only accept patients who have not yet started treatment or specific subtypes of laryngeal cancer, which could limit options.
2. **Potential Risks:** New treatments might have unknown side effects or risks that are not present in standard therapies.
3. **Commitment to Follow-Up:** Participation may require a significant time commitment for follow-up tests and visits as researchers monitor treatment effects and efficacy.
4. **Variable Outcomes:** There is no guarantee that participation will lead to better outcomes than existing treatments, as trials can yield mixed results.

                    There are different types of treatment for children with Ewing sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for children with Ewing sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with Ewing sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with Ewing sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Surgical oncologist or orthopedic oncologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Treatment for Ewing sarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:          - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer). Patients treated for Ewing sarcoma have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia and myelodysplastic syndrome. There is also an increased risk of sarcoma in the area treated with radiation therapy.        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    Systemic chemotherapy is part of the treatment for all patients with Ewing tumors. It is often the first treatment given and lasts for about 6 to 12 months. Chemotherapy is often given to shrink the tumor before surgery or radiation therapy and to kill any tumor cells that may have spread to other parts of the body.    See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           External radiation therapy is used to treat Ewing sarcoma.    Radiation therapy is used when the tumor cannot be removed by surgery or when surgery to remove the tumor will affect important body functions or the way the child will look. It may be used to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. It may also be used to treat any tumor that remains after surgery and tumors that have spread to other parts of the body.       Surgery    Surgery is usually done to remove cancer that is left after chemotherapy or radiation therapy. When possible, the whole tumor is removed by surgery. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft, which uses tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body or a donor. Sometimes an implant, such as artificial bone, is used.    Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy or radiation therapy given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back is called adjuvant therapy.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma. It is being studied for the treatment of metastatic Ewing sarcoma. Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     New types of targeted therapy are being studied.            -  Kinase inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. Kinase inhibitors are drugs that block a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. They are being studied in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma.      -  PARP inhibitor therapy is another type of targeted therapy. PARP inhibitors are drugs that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. They are being studied in the treatment of recurrent Ewing sarcoma.              High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy to treat Ewing sarcoma and then replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells. Chemotherapy with stem cell rescue is used to treat recurrent Ewing sarcoma.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma that has recurred.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment, while others may include patients who are undergoing or have already completed treatment. Patients can typically enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.

Currently, several new treatments are being studied in clinical trials for Ewing sarcoma, including:

1. **Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy** - This is a type of immunotherapy that modifies the patient's T cells to attack cancer cells.
2. **Targeted therapy with monoclonal antibodies** - This treatment specifically seeks out and targets cancer cells.
3. **High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue** - This involves administering high doses of chemotherapy followed by restoring the blood-forming cells.
4. **PARP inhibitor therapy** - These drugs block DNA repair mechanisms in cancer cells.

Additionally, other treatment combinations, such as chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, are also being explored in clinical trials for localized, metastatic, and recurrent Ewing sarcoma.",71,"What are the criteria for enrolling in clinical trials for Ewing sarcoma, and what types of new treatments are currently being studied in these trials?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the criteria for enrolling in clinical trials for Ewing sarcoma, as stated in the original answer.

                    After an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. For extragonadal germ cell tumors, prognostic groups are used instead of stages. The tumors are grouped according to how well the cancer is expected to respond to treatment. It is important to know the prognostic group in order to plan treatment.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if an extragonadal germ cell tumor spreads to the lung, the tumor cells in the lung are actually cancerous germ cells. The disease is metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumor, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors:
                    Good prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the levels of tumor markers AFP and -hCG are normal and LDH is slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:            - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Intermediate prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is more than slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:            - the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Poor prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the poor prognosis group if:            - the tumor is in the chest; or     -  the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is high.            Seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor does not have a poor prognosis group.","The significance of tumor markers such as AFP (Alpha-fetoprotein), -hCG (Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin), and LDH (Lactate dehydrogenase) in determining the prognosis of extragonadal germ cell tumors lies in their ability to help categorize the tumor into prognostic groups, guiding treatment decisions.

In the context of extragonadal germ cell tumors, these tumor markers are used to assess the tumor's characteristics and expected behavior:

- **Good Prognosis**: For nonseminoma tumors, they are classified in the good prognosis group if AFP and -hCG levels are normal and LDH is slightly above normal. For seminoma tumors, having normal AFP levels qualifies them for the good prognosis group, regardless of -hCG and LDH levels.

- **Intermediate Prognosis**: If any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is more than slightly above normal for nonseminomas, the tumor falls into the intermediate prognosis group.

- **Poor Prognosis**: Nonseminoma tumors are in the poor prognosis group if any of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) are high, or if the tumor is situated in the chest or has spread beyond the lungs.

Thus, monitoring the levels of these tumor markers is crucial in deciding the prognosis and optimizing treatment plans for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.",21,"Can you explain the significance of tumor markers such as AFP, -hCG, and LDH in determining the prognosis of extragonadal germ cell tumors?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the role of tumor markers AFP, -hCG, and LDH in determining the prognosis of extragonadal germ cell tumors, aligning closely with the details provided in the original answer.

                    After chronic myelogenous leukemia has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. There is no standard staging system for chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML). Instead, the disease is classified by phase: chronic phase, accelerated phase, or blastic phase. It is important to know the phase in order to plan treatment. The information from tests and procedures done to detect (find) and diagnose chronic myelogenous leukemia is also used to plan treatment.
                
                
                    Chronic myelogenous leukemia has 3 phases.
                    As the amount of blast cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may result in infections, anemia, and easy bleeding, as well as bone pain and pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side. The number of blast cells in the blood and bone marrow and the severity of signs or symptoms determine the phase of the disease.     Chronic phase    In chronic phase CML, fewer than 10% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells.       Accelerated phase    In accelerated phase CML, 10% to 19% of the cells in the blood and bone marrow are blast cells.       Blastic phase    In blastic phase CML, 20% or more of the cells in the blood or bone marrow are blast cells. When tiredness, fever, and an enlarged spleen occur during the blastic phase, it is called blast crisis.","To determine if chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML) has spread beyond its initial site, several diagnostic tests are commonly used, including:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: To check for general signs of health and any signs of disease, such as an enlarged spleen.
2. **Complete Blood Count (CBC) with Differential**: This test involves drawing a blood sample to evaluate the number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets, as well as hemoglobin levels.
3. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: A blood sample is checked for abnormal levels of substances released by organs and tissues.
4. **Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy**: This involves removing a sample of bone marrow and blood to look for abnormal cells under a microscope.
5. **Cytogenetic Analysis**: A test to find certain chromosome changes, such as the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome.
6. **FISH (Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization)**: A technique to examine genes or chromosomes for abnormalities.
7. **Reverse Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR)**: A test that looks for changes in the structure or function of genes in the tissue sample.

These tests help ascertain the phase of the disease and guide treatment planning.",574,What diagnostic tests are commonly used to determine if chronic myelogenous leukemia has spread beyond its initial site?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question about diagnostic tests for determining the spread of chronic myelogenous leukemia, which is relevant to the topic.

                    Small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
                    The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs that are found in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body when you breathe in and take out carbon dioxide when you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung, which is slightly larger, has three. A thin membrane called the pleura surrounds the lungs. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also affected by lung cancer. Small tubes called bronchioles and tiny air sacs called alveoli make up the inside of the lungs.     There are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.    This summary is about small cell lung cancer and its treatment. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about lung cancer:          -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment     -  Lung Cancer Prevention     -  Lung Cancer Screening
                
                
                    There are two main types of small cell lung cancer.
                    These two types include many different types of cells. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look when viewed under a microscope:         - Small cell carcinoma (oat cell cancer).     - Combined small cell carcinoma.
                
                
                    For most patients with small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
                    If lung cancer is found, patients should think about taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","The main risk factor associated with the development of small cell lung cancer is smoking. Smoking is identified as the major risk factor for this disease, meaning that the likelihood of developing small cell lung cancer increases significantly with a history of smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, whether now or in the past. The earlier in life a person begins smoking, the more frequently they smoke, and the longer the duration of smoking, the greater their risk of developing small cell lung cancer.

The implications of this risk factor are substantial, particularly for public health. Since small cell lung cancer is strongly linked to tobacco use, efforts to reduce smoking rates through education, prevention programs, and smoking cessation initiatives can potentially lower the incidence of this type of lung cancer. It’s also important for individuals, particularly smokers or former smokers, to be aware of their heightened risk and to engage in regular health screenings and discussions with their healthcare providers about lung cancer symptoms and risk management.",36,Can you explain the main risk factor associated with the development of small cell lung cancer and its implications?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the main risk factor for small cell lung cancer, which is smoking, aligning with the original answer's point.

                    Ovarian germ cell tumor is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the germ (egg) cells of the ovary.
                    Germ cell tumors begin in the reproductive cells (egg or sperm) of the body. Ovarian germ cell tumors usually occur in teenage girls or young women and most often affect just one ovary.    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones.      Ovarian germ cell tumor is a general name that is used to describe several different types of cancer. The most common ovarian germ cell tumor is called dysgerminoma.

Specifically, individuals may experience:

- Swelling of the abdomen without concurrent weight gain in other parts of the body.
- Bleeding from the vagina after menopause, indicating potential abnormality.

These symptoms may occur even though early-stage ovarian germ cell tumors often do not present noticeable signs. Additionally, such tumors are sometimes identified during regular gynecologic exams.

"Diagnostic tests and a biopsy are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. The diagnostic tests that are done depend in part on where the cancer forms. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   X-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the body, such as the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, pelvis, or lymph nodes, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the skull, brain, and lymph nodes. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones with cancer and is detected by a scanner.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone. Samples are removed from both hipbones. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer cells. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.        If these tests show there may be a rhabdomyosarcoma, a biopsy is done. A biopsy is the removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Because treatment depends on the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, biopsy samples should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma.    One of the following types of biopsies may be used:         -   Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.     -   Core needle biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.    -   Open biopsy : The removal of tissue through an incision (cut) made in the skin.     -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.        The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Light microscopy: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.    -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.    -   FISH (fluorescence in situ hybridization): A laboratory test used to look at genes or chromosomes in cells and tissues. Pieces of DNA that contain a fluorescent dye are made in the laboratory and added to cells or tissues on a glass slide. When these pieces of DNA attach to certain genes or areas of chromosomes on the slide, they light up when viewed under a microscope with a special light. This type of test is used to find certain gene changes.    -   Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for certain changes in the structure or function of genes.    -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.","The significance of conducting a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in the context of diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma lies in its ability to determine whether the cancer has spread to the bone marrow, which is crucial for staging and treatment planning. During this procedure, a hollow needle is inserted into the hipbone to remove samples of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone. 

Examining these samples under a microscope allows the pathologist to look for signs of cancer, such as unusual cells or cancerous changes in the marrow. This information is vital because it helps establish the extent of the disease, assists in confirming the diagnosis of rhabdomyosarcoma, and influences the subsequent treatment strategy. The findings can indicate whether the cancer is localized or has metastasized, which is critical for determining the prognosis and treatment options available.",560,"What is the significance of conducting a bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in the context of rhabdomyosarcoma diagnosis, and what can doctors learn from examining the samples under a microscope?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects the significance of bone marrow aspiration and biopsy in diagnosing rhabdomyosarcoma, detailing its role in determining whether the cancer has spread to the bone marrow and what can be learned from examining the samples.

                    Male breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.
                    Breast cancer may occur in men. Men at any age may develop breast cancer, but it is usually detected (found) in men between 60 and 70 years of age. Male breast cancer makes up less than 1% of all cases of breast cancer.   The following types of breast cancer are found in men:         -  Infiltrating ductal carcinoma: Cancer that has spread beyond the cells lining ducts in the breast. Most men with breast cancer have this type of cancer.    -  Ductal carcinoma in situ: Abnormal cells that are found in the lining of a duct; also called intraductal carcinoma.    -  Inflammatory breast cancer: A type of cancer in which the breast looks red and swollen and feels warm.     -  Paget disease of the nipple: A tumor that has grown from ducts beneath the nipple onto the surface of the nipple.          Lobular carcinoma in situ (abnormal cells found in one of the lobes or sections of the breast), which sometimes occurs in women, has not been seen in men.
                
                
                    Men with breast cancer usually have lumps that can be felt.
                    Lumps and other signs may be caused by male breast cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you notice a change in your breasts.","The primary risk factors that contribute to the development of male breast cancer are:

1. **Radiation Exposure**: Previous exposure to radiation, particularly in the chest area, increases the risk of developing breast cancer.
2. **High Levels of Estrogen**: Conditions that lead to elevated estrogen levels can increase the likelihood of male breast cancer. This may occur due to genetic conditions, substance abuse (such as alcohol), or certain health conditions.
3. **Family History of Breast Cancer**: A family history of breast cancer in relatives, particularly if that history includes male breast cancer, signifies a higher risk for male individuals.

These risk factors can significantly affect a man's likelihood of being diagnosed with breast cancer, as they can contribute to the biological susceptibility to the disease.

                    Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.
                    The skin is the body's largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (top or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer). Skin cancer begins in the epidermis, which is made up of three kinds of cells:         -  Squamous cells: Thin, flat cells that form the top layer of the epidermis. Cancer that forms in squamous cells is called squamous cell carcinoma.    -  Basal cells: Round cells under the squamous cells. Cancer that forms in basal cells is called basal cell carcinoma.    -  Melanocytes: Found in the lower part of the epidermis, these cells make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment and cause the skin to tan, or darken. Cancer that forms in melanocytes is called melanoma.
                
                
                    Nonmelanoma skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.
                    Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancer and are the most common forms of skin cancer. Most basal cell and squamous cell skin cancers can be cured.    Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Melanoma is easier to cure if the tumor is found before it spreads to the dermis (inner layer of skin). Melanoma is less likely to cause death when it is found and treated early.    In the United States, the number of cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer seems to have increased in recent years. The number of cases of melanoma has increased over the last 30 years. Part of the reason for these increases may be that people are more aware of skin cancer. They are more likely to have skin exams and biopsies and to be diagnosed with skin cancer.   Over the past 20 years, the number of deaths from melanoma has decreased slightly among white men and women younger than 50 years. During that time, the number of deaths from melanoma has increased slightly among white men older than 50 years and stayed about the same among white women older than 50 years.   The number of cases of childhood melanoma diagnosed in the United States is low, but increasing over time. The number of childhood deaths from melanoma has stayed about the same.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about skin cancer:         -   Skin Cancer Prevention     -  Skin Cancer Treatment     -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Genetics of Skin Cancer","Ultraviolet (UV) radiation plays a significant role in the risk of developing skin cancer, particularly nonmelanoma types. It is a known risk factor, with long-term exposure to both natural sunlight and artificial sources of UV radiation, such as sunlamps and tanning beds, increasing the likelihood of skin cancer, including basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma. People with fair skin that freckles easily, as well as those with light-colored eyes and hair, are particularly at risk.

                    Adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infection and the growth of tumors. There are three types of lymphocytes:               -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection. Also called B cells. Most types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begin in B lymphocytes.      -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection. Also called T cells.      -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses. Also called NK cells.          Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and also collect in the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.    - Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.     - Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. It is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    - Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs.   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy is rare. Non-Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However, treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information on the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy (see the Treatment Options for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma During Pregnancy section for more information).    Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)
                
                
                    The major types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    For information about certain types of lymphoma, see the following PDQ summaries:          -  Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment (lymphoblastic lymphoma)    -  Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment     -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment (small lymphocytic lymphoma)    -  Mycosis Fungoides and the Szary Syndrome Treatment (cutaneous T-cell lymphoma)    -  Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment
                
                 
                    Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be indolent or aggressive.
                    Non-Hodgkin lymphoma grows and spreads at different rates and can be indolent or aggressive. Indolent lymphoma tends to grow and spread slowly, and has few signs and symptoms. Aggressive lymphoma grows and spreads quickly, and has signs and symptoms that can be severe. The treatments for indolent and aggressive lymphoma are different.   This summary is about the following types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma:       Indolent non-Hodgkin lymphomas             -   Follicular lymphoma. Follicular lymphoma is the most common type of indolent non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a very slow-growing type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in B lymphocytes. It affects the lymph nodes and may spread to the bone marrow or spleen. Most patients with follicular lymphoma are age 50 years and older when they are diagnosed. Follicular lymphoma may go away without treatment. The patient is closely watched for signs or symptoms that the disease has come back. Treatment is needed if signs or symptoms occur after the cancer disappeared or after initial cancer treatment. Sometimes follicular lymphoma can become a more aggressive type of lymphoma, such as diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.     -   Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. In most cases of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, B lymphocytes that are turning into plasma cells make large amounts of a protein called monoclonal immunoglobulin M (IgM) antibody. High levels of IgM antibody in the blood cause the blood plasma to thicken. This may cause signs or symptoms such as trouble seeing or hearing, heart problems, shortness of breath, headache, dizziness, and numbness or tingling of the hands and feet. Sometimes there are no signs or symptoms of lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. It may be found when a blood test is done for another reason. Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma often spreads to the bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen. It is also called Waldenstrm macroglobulinemia.     -   Marginal zone lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in B lymphocytes in a part of lymph tissue called the marginal zone. There are five different types of marginal zone lymphoma. They are grouped by the type of tissue where the lymphoma formed:                   - Nodal marginal zone lymphoma. Nodal marginal zone lymphoma forms in lymph nodes. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is rare. It is also called monocytoid B-cell lymphoma.       -  Gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma. Gastric MALT lymphoma usually begins in the stomach. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Patients with gastric MALT lymphoma may also have  Helicobacter  gastritis or an autoimmune disease, such as Hashimoto thyroiditis or Sjgren syndrome.        - Extragastric MALT lymphoma. Extragastric MALT lymphoma begins outside of the stomach in almost every part of the body including other parts of the gastrointestinal tract, salivary glands, thyroid, lung, skin, and around the eye. This type of marginal zone lymphoma forms in cells in the mucosa that help make antibodies. Extragastric MALT lymphoma may come back many years after treatment.       - Mediterranean abdominal lymphoma. This is a type of MALT lymphoma that occurs in young adults in eastern Mediterranean countries. It often forms in the abdomen and patients may also be infected with bacteria called Campylobacter jejuni. This type of lymphoma is also called immunoproliferative small intestinal disease.       -  Splenic marginal zone lymphoma. This type of marginal zone lymphoma begins in the spleen and may spread to the peripheral blood and bone marrow. The most common sign of this type of splenic marginal zone lymphoma is a spleen that is larger than normal.                -   Primary cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is in the skin only. It can be a benign (not cancer) nodule that may go away on its own or it can spread to many places on the skin and need treatment.                Aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphomas             -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It grows quickly in the lymph nodes and often the spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also affected. Signs and symptoms of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma may include fever, recurring night sweats, and weight loss. These are also called B symptoms. Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma is a type of diffuse large B-cell lymphoma.                  - Primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is marked by the overgrowth of fibrous (scar-like) lymph tissue. A tumor most often forms behind the breastbone. It may press on the airways and cause coughing and trouble breathing. Most patients with primary mediastinal large B-cell lymphoma are women who are age 30 to 40 years.                -   Follicular large cell lymphoma, stage III. Follicular large cell lymphoma, stage III, is a very rare type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is more like diffuse large B-cell lymphoma than other types of follicular lymphoma.     -  Anaplastic large cell lymphoma. Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually begins in T lymphocytes. The cancer cells also have a marker called CD30 on the surface of the cell.  There are two types of anaplastic large cell lymphoma:                  - Cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma mostly affects the skin, but other parts of the body may also be affected. Signs of cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma include one or more bumps or ulcers on the skin.       -  Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma. This type of anaplastic large cell lymphoma begins in the lymph nodes and may affect other parts of the body. Patients may have a lot of anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK) protein inside the lymphoma cells. These patients have a better prognosis than patients who do not have extra ALK protein. Systemic anaplastic large cell lymphoma is more common in children than adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)                -   Extranodal NK -/T-cell lymphoma. Extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma usually begins in the area around the nose. It may also affect the paranasal sinus (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), roof of the mouth, trachea, skin, stomach, and intestines. Most cases of extranodal NK-/T-cell lymphoma have Epstein-Barr virus in the tumor cells. Sometimes hemophagocytic syndrome occurs (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma is not common in the United States.      -   Lymphomatoid granulomatosis. Lymphomatoid granulomatosis mostly affects the lungs. It may also affect the paranasal sinuses (hollow spaces in the bones around the nose), skin, kidneys, and central nervous system. In lymphomatoid granulomatosis, cancer invades the blood vessels and kills tissue. Because the cancer may spread to the brain, intrathecal chemotherapy or radiation therapy to the brain is given.     -   Angioimmunoblastic T-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma begins in T cells. Swollen lymph nodes are a common sign. Other signs may include a skin rash, fever, weight loss, or night sweats. There may also be high levels of gamma globulin (antibodies) in the blood. Patients may also have opportunistic infections because their immune systems are weakened.     -   Peripheral T-cell lymphoma. Peripheral T-cell lymphoma begins in mature T lymphocytes. This type of T lymphocyte matures in the thymus gland and travels to other lymphatic sites in the body such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen. There are three subtypes of peripheral T-cell lymphoma:                  - Hepatosplenic T-cell lymphoma. This is an uncommon type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma that occurs mostly in young men. It begins in the liver and spleen and the cancer cells also have a T-cell receptor called gamma/delta on the surface of the cell.        -  Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma. Subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin or mucosa. It may occur with hemophagocytic syndrome (a serious condition in which there are too many active histiocytes and T cells that cause severe inflammation in the body). Treatment to suppress the immune system is needed.       - Enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma. This type of peripheral T-cell lymphoma occurs in the small bowel of patients with untreated celiac disease (an immune response to gluten that causes malnutrition). Patients who are diagnosed with celiac disease in childhood and stay on a gluten-free diet rarely develop enteropathy-type intestinal T-cell lymphoma.                -  Intravascular large B-cell lymphoma. This type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma affects blood vessels, especially the small blood vessels in the brain, kidney, lung, and skin. Signs and symptoms of intravascular large B-cell lymphoma are caused by blocked blood vessels. It is also called intravascular lymphomatosis.     -   Burkitt lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows and spreads very quickly. It may affect the jaw, bones of the face, bowel, kidneys, ovaries, or other organs. There are three main types of Burkitt lymphoma (endemic, sporadic, and immunodeficiency related). Endemic Burkitt lymphoma commonly occurs in Africa and is linked to the Epstein-Barr virus, and sporadic Burkitt lymphoma occurs throughout the world. Immunodeficiency-related Burkitt lymphoma is most often seen in patients who have AIDS. Burkitt lymphoma may spread to the brain and spinal cord and treatment to prevent its spread may be given. Burkitt lymphoma occurs most often in children and young adults (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.) Burkitt lymphoma is also called diffuse small noncleaved-cell lymphoma.     -   Lymphoblastic lymphoma. Lymphoblastic lymphoma may begin in T cells or B cells, but it usually begins in T cells. In this type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma, there are too many lymphoblasts (immature white blood cells) in the lymph nodes and the thymus gland. These lymphoblasts may spread to other places in the body, such as the bone marrow, brain, and spinal cord. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is most common in teenagers and young adults. It is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (lymphoblasts are mostly found in the bone marrow and blood). (See the PDQ summary on Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment for more information.)     -   Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma. Adult T-cell leukemia/lymphoma is caused by the human T-cell leukemia virus type 1 (HTLV-1). Signs include bone and skin lesions, high blood calcium levels, and lymph nodes, spleen, and liver that are larger than normal.      -   Mantle cell lymphoma. Mantle cell lymphoma is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that usually occurs in middle-aged or older adults. It begins in the lymph nodes and spreads to the spleen, bone marrow, blood, and sometimes the esophagus, stomach, and intestines. Patients with mantle cell lymphoma have too much of a protein called cyclin-D1 or a certain gene change in the lymphoma cells. In some patients who do not have signs or symptoms of lymphoma delaying the start of treatment does not affect the prognosis.     -   Posttransplantation lymphoproliferative disorder. This disease occurs in patients who have had a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas transplant and need lifelong immunosuppressive therapy. Most posttransplant lymphoproliferative disorders affect the B cells and have Epstein-Barr virus in the cells. Lymphoproliferative disorders are often treated like cancer.      -  True histiocytic lymphoma. This is a rare, very aggressive type of lymphoma. It is not known whether it begins in B cells or T cells. It does not respond well to treatment with standard chemotherapy.     -   Primary effusion lymphoma. Primary effusion lymphoma begins in B cells that are found in an area where there is a large build-up of fluid, such as the areas between the lining of the lung and chest wall (pleural effusion), the sac around the heart and the heart (pericardial effusion), or in the abdominal cavity. There is usually no tumor that can be seen. This type of lymphoma often occurs in patients who have AIDS.     -   Plasmablastic lymphoma. Plasmablastic lymphoma is a type of large B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that is very aggressive. It is most often seen in patients with HIV infection.","The risk of developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma can be influenced by several factors, particularly age and gender. Specifically, the following points summarize these influences:

- **Age**: The risk of developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma increases with age. Older individuals are at a higher risk.
- **Gender**: Men are generally at a higher risk compared to women for developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
- **A weakened immune system**: This condition can also elevate the risk of developing the disease.

These risk factors indicate that being older, male, and having a compromised immune system can contribute to an increased likelihood of developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.",346,"What factors can influence the risk of developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly in relation to age and gender?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the factors influencing the risk of developing adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, specifically mentioning age, gender, and weakened immune system, all of which were detailed in the original answer. It remains focused on the specific question asked and reflects the key points from the original content."
"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","Participating in a clinical trial for Small Cell Lung Cancer patients can offer several potential benefits:

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may receive new cancer treatments that are not yet available through standard care. These treatments are being tested to determine their safety and effectiveness.

2. **Contribution to Medical Research**: By participating in clinical trials, patients contribute to the advancement of cancer research, which may help improve treatment options for future patients.

3. **Possibility of Better Outcomes**: Some clinical trials may provide access to more effective treatment strategies that could improve the chances of recovery or manage the disease more effectively than current standard treatments.

4. **Careful Monitoring**: Participants in clinical trials often receive closer monitoring and follow-up care, which can lead to a better understanding of their health status and responses to treatment.

5. **Options When Standard Treatments Fail**: For patients whose cancer does not respond to existing treatments, clinical trials may offer alternative options that could be more beneficial.

6. **Pioneering Advances**: Many existing cancer treatments have been developed as a result of previous clinical trials, and participation can help pave the way for future breakthroughs.

                    - AIDS-related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).    - There are many different types of lymphoma.    - Signs of AIDS-related lymphoma include weight loss, fever, and night sweats.    - Tests that examine the lymph system and other parts of the body are used to help detect (find) and diagnose AIDS-related lymphoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    AIDS-related lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system of patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS).
                    AIDS is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), which attacks and weakens the body's immune system. The immune system is then unable to fight infection and disease. People with HIV disease have an increased risk of infection and lymphoma or other types of cancer. A person with HIV disease who develops certain types of infections or cancer is then diagnosed with AIDS. Sometimes, people are diagnosed with AIDS and AIDS-related lymphoma at the same time. For information about AIDS and its treatment, please see the AIDSinfo website.   AIDS-related lymphoma is a type of cancer that affects the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.    -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.     -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.        Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the brain, stomach, thyroid gland, and skin.   Sometimes AIDS-related lymphoma occurs outside the lymph nodes in the bone marrow, liver, meninges (thin membranes that cover the brain) and gastrointestinal tract. Less often, it may occur in the anus, heart, bile duct, gingiva, and muscles.
                
                
                    There are many different types of lymphoma.
                    Lymphomas are divided into two general types:         -  Hodgkin lymphoma.    -  Non-Hodgkin lymphoma.        Both Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma may occur in patients with AIDS, but non-Hodgkin lymphoma is more common. When a person with AIDS has non-Hodgkin lymphoma, it is called AIDS-related lymphoma. When AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in the central nervous system (CNS), it is called AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma.   Non-Hodgkin lymphomas are grouped by the way their cells look under a microscope. They may be indolent (slow-growing) or aggressive (fast-growing). AIDS-related lymphomas are aggressive. There are two main types of AIDS-related non-Hodgkin lymphoma:         -  Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (including B-cell immunoblastic lymphoma).    -  Burkitt or Burkitt-like lymphoma.        For more information about lymphoma or AIDS-related cancers, see the following PDQ summaries:         -  Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment     -  Kaposi Sarcoma Treatment","The immune system's function is closely related to the development of AIDS-related lymphoma in individuals infected with HIV because the HIV virus attacks and weakens the immune system. This weakening renders the body unable to effectively fight infections and diseases, leading to an increased risk of various cancers, including lymphoma. Specifically, AIDS-related lymphoma occurs in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), a condition that arises when HIV has significantly compromised the immune system. In this context, the immune system's inability to function properly makes it harder for the body to control abnormal cell growth, resulting in the development of malignant cells in the lymphatic system.",305,How does the immune system's function relate to the development of AIDS-related lymphoma in individuals infected with HIV?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the question by explaining the relationship between the immune system's function and the development of AIDS-related lymphoma in individuals infected with HIV. It highlights how HIV weakens the immune system and increases the risk of cancers, specifically AIDS-related lymphoma, which aligns with the original answer's discussion on AIDS-related lymphoma and its association with the immune system."

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian germ cell tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian germ cell tumor. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is the most common treatment of ovarian germ cell tumor. A doctor may take out the cancer using one of the following types of surgery.             -  Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube.      -  Total hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus, including the cervix. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.     -  Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.     -  Tumor debulking: A surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed. Some tumors cannot be completely removed.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be offered chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    After chemotherapy for an ovarian germ cell tumor, a second-look laparotomy may be done. This is similar to the laparotomy that is done to find out the stage of the cancer. Second-look laparotomy is a surgical procedure to find out if tumor cells are left after primary treatment. During this procedure, the doctor will take samples of lymph nodes and other tissues in the abdomen to see if any cancer is left. This procedure is not done for dysgerminomas.       Observation     Observation is closely watching a patients condition without giving any treatment unless signs or symptoms appear or change.        Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat ovarian germ cell tumors.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with bone marrow transplant is a method of giving very high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.       New treatment options      Combination chemotherapy (the use of more than one anticancer drug) is being tested in clinical trials.

                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Liver cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the liver.
                    The liver is one of the largest organs in the body. It has four lobes and fills the upper right side of the abdomen inside the rib cage. Three of the many important functions of the liver are:         - To filter harmful substances from the blood so they can be passed from the body in stools and urine.    - To make bile to help digest fats from food.     - To store glycogen (sugar), which the body uses for energy.

                    Liver cancer is not common in the United States.
                    Liver cancer is the fourth most common cancer and the third leading cause of cancer death in the world. In the United States, men, especially Asian/Pacific Islander men, have an increased risk of liver cancer. The number of new cases of liver cancer and the number of deaths from liver cancer continue to increase, especially among middle-aged black, Hispanic, and white men. People are usually older than 40 years when they develop this cancer.    Finding and treating liver cancer early may prevent death from liver cancer.","The primary functions of the liver that might be affected by hepatocellular cancer include:

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.

                    Ewing sarcoma is described based on whether the cancer has spread from the bone or soft tissue in which the cancer began.
                    Ewing sarcoma is described as either localized or metastatic.      Localized Ewing sarcoma    The cancer is found in the bone or soft tissue in which it began and may have spread to nearby tissue, including nearby lymph nodes.       Metastatic Ewing sarcoma     The cancer has spread from the bone or soft tissue in which it began to other parts of the body. In Ewing tumor of bone, the cancer most often spreads to the lung, other bones, and bone marrow.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if Ewing sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually Ewing sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic Ewing sarcoma, not lung cancer.","Ewing sarcoma typically metastasizes to several common sites in the body. The most frequent locations include the lungs, other bones, and bone marrow. This pattern of metastasis has significant implications for treatment options. 

For metastatic Ewing sarcoma, standard treatments include chemotherapy, surgery, and radiation therapy, which will be tailored based on the specific areas where the tumor has spread and the overall health of the patient. Additionally, high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue may be considered, along with the exploration of clinical trials investigating new combination therapies, targeted therapies, and other innovative treatments.

Overall, the metastatic nature of Ewing sarcoma necessitates a comprehensive and individualized treatment approach, taking into account the tumor's spread and the patient's unique circumstances.",70,"What are the common sites to which Ewing sarcoma typically metastasizes, and how does this affect treatment options?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses common metastatic sites for Ewing sarcoma, which aligns with parts of the original answer.

                    After childhood liver cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the liver or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the liver, to nearby tissues or organs, or to other parts of the body is called staging. In childhood liver cancer, the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups are used instead of stage to plan treatment. The results of the tests and procedures done to detect, diagnose, and find out whether the cancer has spread are used to determine the PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups.
                
                
                    There are two grouping systems for childhood liver cancer.
                    Two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer:         - The PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment.    - The POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment.
                
                
                    There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups:
                    The liver is divided into 4 sections. The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer.     PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I     In group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II     In group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III     In group III, one of the following is true:            -  Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer.     - Cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.              PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV     In group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.

                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells. The disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer.","In terms of tumor location within the liver, PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I differs from Group IV as follows:

- **PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I**: The cancer is found in **one section** of the liver, while three sections that are next to each other do not have cancer.
  
- **PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV**: The cancer is found in **all four sections** of the liver.

"The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether the cancer is in one or both eyes.    - The size and number of tumors.    - Whether the tumor has spread to the area around the eye, to the brain, or to other parts of the body.    - Whether there are symptoms at the time of diagnosis, for trilateral retinoblastoma.    - The age of the child.    - How likely it is that vision can be saved in one or both eyes.    - Whether a second type of cancer has formed.","The size and number of tumors significantly influence the treatment options available for Retinoblastoma. For smaller tumors, treatments such as systemic chemotherapy, ophthalmic artery infusion chemotherapy, cryotherapy, and thermotherapy may be considered, with the goal of preserving the eye and vision. However, if the tumors are large and it is unlikely that vision can be saved, surgery (enucleation) to remove the eye may be necessary, often followed by additional systemic chemotherapy to reduce the risk of cancer spreading.

In cases of bilateral retinoblastoma (tumors in both eyes), the treatment approach may vary for each eye based on the specific size and extent of the tumors. Treatment regimens are typically determined by the size of the tumors, indicating that larger or multiple tumors may require more aggressive treatment options, including high-dose chemotherapy or radiation therapy, as opposed to less invasive measures for smaller, localized tumors. Thus, the size and number of tumors are critical factors in tailoring the most effective treatment strategy for each patient.",650,How do the size and number of tumors influence the treatment options available for Retinoblastoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses how the size and number of tumors influence treatment options for Retinoblastoma, which directly aligns with points made in the original answer regarding treatment options being contingent on tumor characteristics.

                    After small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)    Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:         -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain, chest or upper abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.    -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. The disease is metastatic small cell lung cancer, not brain cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for small cell lung cancer:
                    Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer    In limited-stage, cancer is in the lung where it started and may have spread to the area between the lungs or to the lymph nodes above the collarbone.        Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer    In extensive-stage, cancer has spread beyond the lung or the area between the lungs or the lymph nodes above the collarbone to other places in the body.","The mechanisms by which small cell lung cancer spreads throughout the body include:

1. **Tissue Invasion**: Cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas in the lungs and surrounding tissues.

2. **Lymphatic Spread**: The cancer can enter the lymph system, traveling through lymph vessels to other parts of the body, leading to the formation of tumors (metastatic tumors) in distant locations.

3. **Hematogenous Spread**: Cancer cells can invade the bloodstream, allowing them to spread via blood vessels to distant organs, forming metastatic tumors elsewhere in the body.

When small cell lung cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is referred to as metastasis, where the cancer cells retain their original characteristics (e.g., lung cancer cells spreading to the brain).",40,What are the mechanisms by which small cell lung cancer spreads throughout the body?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes and restates the mechanisms by which small cell lung cancer spreads, including tissue invasion, lymphatic spread, and hematogenous spread. It aligns closely with the original content regarding ways of spreading cancer and also incorporates the concept of metastasis, reflecting a deep understanding of the topic."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The patient's age.     - Where in the body the tumor started.    - The size of the tumor at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the tumor has been completely removed by surgery.    - The type of rhabdomyosarcoma (embryonal, alveolar, or anaplastic).    - Whether there are certain changes in the genes.    - Whether the tumor had spread to other parts of the body at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the tumor was in the lymph nodes at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the tumor responds to chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy.        For patients with recurrent cancer, prognosis and treatment also depend on the following:         - Where in the body the tumor recurred (came back).    - How much time passed between the end of cancer treatment and when the cancer recurred.    - Whether the tumor was treated with radiation therapy.","The size of the tumor at diagnosis significantly impacts the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes for rhabdomyosarcoma. Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma categorizes tumors based on their size, location, and whether they have spread to other parts of the body. For instance:

- **Stage 1**: The tumor can be any size, but when found in a ""favorable"" location, it tends to have a better prognosis.
- **Stage 2**: The tumor is limited to an ""unfavorable"" site and is no larger than 5 centimeters, which still retains a relatively good outlook.
- **Stage 3 and 4**: These stages involve larger tumor sizes and possible metastasis, decreasing the chances of successful treatment outcomes.

Moreover, treatment strategies and risk group classifications (low, intermediate, or high risk) depend on the tumor's size and its removal status during surgery. Thus, larger tumors or those classified at higher stages are associated with increased risk and potentially poorer prognoses, impacting treatment effectiveness and outcomes.",561,In what ways does the size of the tumor at diagnosis impact the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes for rhabdomyosarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of tumor size at diagnosis on treatment outcomes for rhabdomyosarcoma, which is a key factor mentioned in the original answer.

                    Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.
                    In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the body tells too many blood stem cells to become two types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells are called blasts. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.","The potential complications of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) related to the overcrowding of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow include:

1. **Infection**: The excessive production of myelocytes, monocytes, and immature white blood cells (blasts) leads to a depletion of healthy white blood cells, which are crucial for fighting infections.

2. **Anemia**: The overcrowding of immature white blood cells can reduce the space available for red blood cell production, resulting in anemia, characterized by fatigue and weakness.

3. **Easy Bleeding**: The increased presence of immature white blood cells can crowd out platelet production, leading to a decreased platelet count and easy bleeding or bruising. 

These complications arise as the immature cells take up space in the bone marrow, displacing the normal production of red blood cells and platelets.",421,What are the potential complications of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia related to the overcrowding of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the potential complications of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) resulting from the overcrowding of immature white blood cells in the bone marrow, which aligns well with the original answer's mention of infection, anemia, and easy bleeding as potential issues.

"Tests that examine the liver and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood liver cancer and find out whether the cancer has spread. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The blood of children who have liver cancer may have increased amounts of a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG) or a protein called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). Other cancers and certain noncancer conditions, including cirrhosis and hepatitis, can also increase AFP levels.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver damage or cancer.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as bilirubin or lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the EBV and DNA markers of the EBV. These are found in the blood of patients who have been infected with EBV.    -  Hepatitis assay : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked for pieces of the hepatitis virus.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the liver. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. In childhood liver cancer, an ultrasound exam of the abdomen to check the large blood vessels is usually done.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. In childhood liver cancer, a CT scan of the chest and abdomen is usually done.    -   Abdominal x-ray : An x-ray of the organs in the abdomen. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of a sample of cells or tissues so it can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. The sample may be taken during surgery to remove or view the tumor. A pathologist looks at the sample under a microscope to find out the type of liver cancer.  The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to check for a certain gene mutation and to tell the difference between different types of cancer.","A biopsy plays a crucial role in diagnosing liver cancer in children by allowing doctors to obtain a sample of liver tissue. This sample is then examined under a microscope to determine whether cancer cells are present, thus confirming a diagnosis of liver cancer.

Once a biopsy is performed, subsequent tests may be conducted on the biopsy sample to provide more information about the cancer. These tests can include assessments of the cancer cells' characteristics, which can influence treatment decisions. The histology of the cancer cells, for example, is important in deciding the appropriate treatment plan, particularly for types like hepatoblastoma.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:            -  Wide local excision: The cancer is cut from the skin along with some of the tissue around it. A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection also may be done.     - Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; for a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    
                
                
                    Treatment for Merkel cell carcinoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Plasma cell neoplasms are diseases in which the body makes too many plasma cells.
                    Plasma cells develop from B lymphocytes (B cells), a type of white blood cell that is made in the bone marrow. Normally, when bacteria or viruses enter the body, some of the B cells will change into plasma cells. The plasma cells make antibodies to fight bacteria and viruses, to stop infection and disease.     Plasma cell neoplasms are diseases in which abnormal plasma cells or myeloma cells form tumors in the bones or soft tissues of the body. The plasma cells also make an antibody protein, called M protein, that is not needed by the body and does not help fight infection. These antibody proteins build up in the bone marrow and can cause the blood to thicken or can damage the kidneys.
                
                
                    Plasma cell neoplasms can be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
                    Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS) is not cancer but can become cancer. The following types of plasma cell neoplasms are cancer:         -  Lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma. (See Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)    -  Plasmacytoma.    -  Multiple myeloma.
                
                
                    There are several types of plasma cell neoplasms.
                    Plasma cell neoplasms include the following:     Monoclonal gammopathy of undetermined significance (MGUS)    In this type of plasma cell neoplasm, less than 10% of the bone marrow is made up of abnormal plasma cells and there is no cancer. The abnormal plasma cells make M protein, which is sometimes found during a routine blood or urine test. In most patients, the amount of M protein stays the same and there are no signs, symptoms, or health problems.     In some patients, MGUS may later become a more serious condition, such as amyloidosis, or cause problems with the kidneys, heart, or nerves. MGUS can also become cancer, such as multiple myeloma, lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma, or chronic lymphocytic leukemia.       Plasmacytoma    In this type of plasma cell neoplasm, the abnormal plasma cells (myeloma cells) are in one place and form one tumor, called a plasmacytoma. Sometimes plasmacytoma can be cured. There are two types of plasmacytoma.            - In isolated plasmacytoma of bone, one plasma cell tumor is found in the bone, less than 10% of the bone marrow is made up of plasma cells, and there are no other signs of cancer. Plasmacytoma of the bone often becomes multiple myeloma.     - In extramedullary plasmacytoma, one plasma cell tumor is found in soft tissue but not in the bone or the bone marrow. Extramedullary plasmacytomas commonly form in tissues of the throat, tonsil, and paranasal sinuses.            Signs and symptoms depend on where the tumor is.            - In bone, the plasmacytoma may cause pain or broken bones.      - In soft tissue, the tumor may press on nearby areas and cause pain or other problems. For example, a plasmacytoma in the throat can make it hard to swallow.               Multiple myeloma    In multiple myeloma, abnormal plasma cells (myeloma cells) build up in the bone marrow and form tumors in many bones of the body. These tumors may keep the bone marrow from making enough healthy blood cells. Normally, the bone marrow makes stem cells (immature cells) that become three types of mature blood cells:            -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.      -  White blood cells that fight infection and disease.      -  Platelets that form blood clots to help prevent bleeding.            As the number of myeloma cells increases, fewer red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets are made. The myeloma cells also damage and weaken the bone.     Sometimes multiple myeloma does not cause any signs or symptoms. This is called smoldering multiple myeloma. It may be found when a blood or urine test is done for another condition. Signs and symptoms may be caused by multiple myeloma or other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:            - Bone pain, especially in the back or ribs.     - Bones that break easily.     -  Fever for no known reason or frequent infections.     - Easy bruising or bleeding.     - Trouble breathing.     - Weakness of the arms or legs.     - Feeling very tired.           A tumor can damage the bone and cause hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood). This can affect many organs in the body, including the kidneys, nerves, heart, muscles, and digestive tract, and cause serious health problems.    Hypercalcemia may cause the following signs and symptoms:             - Loss of appetite.     -  Nausea or vomiting.     - Feeling thirsty.     - Frequent urination.     -  Constipation.     - Feeling very tired.     - Muscle weakness.      - Restlessness.     -  Confusion or trouble thinking.
                
                
                    Multiple myeloma and other plasma cell neoplasms may cause a condition called amyloidosis.
                    In rare cases, multiple myeloma can cause peripheral nerves (nerves that are not in the brain or spinal cord) and organs to fail. This may be caused by a condition called amyloidosis. Antibody proteins build up and stick together in peripheral nerves and organs, such as the kidney and heart. This can cause the nerves and organs to become stiff and unable to work the way they should.    Amyloidosis may cause the following signs and symptoms:         - Feeling very tired.    - Purple spots on the skin.    - Enlarged tongue.    -  Diarrhea.    - Swelling caused by fluid in your body's tissues.    - Tingling or numbness in your legs and feet.","Multiple myeloma can significantly impact the production of healthy blood cells in the bone marrow due to the accumulation of abnormal plasma cells (myeloma cells). As these myeloma cells build up in the bone marrow, they create tumors that hinder the bone marrow's ability to produce adequate numbers of healthy blood cells, including red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets. 

The consequences of this disruption can be severe:
1. **Anemia:** The reduction in red blood cell production can lead to anemia, causing fatigue, weakness, and pallor.
2. **Increased Infections:** A decrease in white blood cells can impair the body's immune response, resulting in a higher susceptibility to infections.
3. **Bleeding Issues:** Insufficient platelet production can lead to easy bruising, bleeding, and difficulty in blood clotting.
4. **Bone Damage:** As the number of myeloma cells increases, they can also weaken and damage the bone, potentially leading to fractures and pain.

Overall, the disruption in blood cell production due to multiple myeloma can lead to a range of serious health complications that require medical management and intervention.",43,"In what ways can multiple myeloma impact the production of healthy blood cells in the bone marrow, and what are the consequences of this disruption?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the impact of multiple myeloma on healthy blood cell production in the bone marrow, clearly outlining the mechanism of disruption and detailing the consequences such as anemia, increased infections, and bleeding issues.

"Tests that examine the rectum and anus are used to detect (find) and diagnose anal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Digital rectal examination (DRE): An exam of the anus and rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the lower part of the rectum to feel for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.    -  Anoscopy: An exam of the anus and lower rectum using a short, lighted tube called an anoscope.     -   Proctoscopy : An exam of the rectum using a short, lighted tube called a proctoscope.    -  Endo-anal or endorectal ultrasound : A procedure in which an ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the anus or rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If an abnormal area is seen during the anoscopy, a biopsy may be done at that time.","Performing a biopsy during the diagnostic process for anal cancer is significant because it involves the removal of cells or tissues, which are then examined under a microscope by a pathologist.

                    Lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
                    The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the body's cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger, and has three lobes. A thin membrane called the pleura surrounds the lungs. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also involved in lung cancer. Tiny air sacs called alveoli and small tubes called bronchioles make up the inside of the lungs.      There are two types of lung cancer: small cell lung cancer and non-small cell lung cancer.

                    After colon cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the colon or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the colon or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen or chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the colon. A substance called gadolinium is injected into the patient through a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Surgery : A procedure to remove the tumor and see how far it has spread through the colon.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) assay : A test that measures the level of CEA in the blood. CEA is released into the bloodstream from both cancer cells and normal cells. When found in higher than normal amounts, it can be a sign of colon cancer or other conditions.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if colon cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually colon cancer cells. The disease is metastatic colon cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for colon cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)     In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). Cancer may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall.       Stage II      Stage II colon cancer is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC.             - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall.      - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall but has not spread to nearby organs.      - Stage IIC: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall to nearby organs.               Stage III     Stage III colon cancer is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.     In stage IIIA:            -  Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes.             In stage IIIB:            - Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall or to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the colon wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the colon wall. Cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes.            In stage IIIC:            - Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall but has not spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the colon wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall or has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the colon wall and has spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes.               Stage IV      Stage IV colon cancer is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.            - Stage IVA: Cancer may have spread through the colon wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. Cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the colon, such as the liver, lung, or ovary, or to a distant lymph node.     - Stage IVB: Cancer may have spread through the colon wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. Cancer has spread to more than one organ that is not near the colon or into the lining of the abdominal wall.","Colon cancer spreads through the body via three main pathways: tissue, the lymph system, and blood.

1. **Tissue:** Cancer can grow directly into nearby areas where it began.

2. **Lymph System:** Colon cancer can enter the lymphatic system, which comprises lymph vessels. Once cancer cells invade the lymph system, they can travel through these vessels to other parts of the body. When they reach a new area, they can establish a new tumor known as a metastatic tumor.

3. **Blood:** Cancer can also enter the bloodstream, allowing cancer cells to travel through blood vessels to distant sites in the body. Like with the lymphatic system, when these cancer cells settle in a new location, they can form a metastatic tumor.

When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is referred to as metastasis. The new tumor retains the characteristics of the original cancer. For instance, if colon cancer spreads to the lungs, the cells in the lungs are colon cancer cells, and this condition is termed metastatic colon cancer, not lung cancer.",187,Can you explain the process of how colon cancer spreads through the lymph system and blood?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the processes through which colon cancer spreads via tissue, the lymph system, and blood, mirroring the detailed information provided in the original answer.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Age      Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.       Family history of prostate cancer     A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.       Race     Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.       Hormones    The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main male sex hormone is testosterone. Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.    Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.       Vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.       Folic acid    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.       Dairy and calcium    A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Folate    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.       Finasteride and Dutasteride     Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.    The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.    The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).
                
                
                    The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
                    Selenium and vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for African-American men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.       Diet    It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.       Multivitamins    Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.       Lycopene    Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for prostate cancer prevention trials that are accepting patients.","Based on the context provided, there are specific dietary recommendations and restrictions that could potentially lower the risk of prostate cancer concerning folate and dairy intake:

1. **Folate**: A diet that includes enough folate can lower the risk of prostate cancer. Folate is naturally found in foods such as green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. However, caution is advised with folic acid supplements; a study indicated that taking 1 milligram (mg) of folic acid supplements increased the risk of prostate cancer. Therefore, it is better to focus on obtaining folate from natural food sources rather than supplements.

2. **Dairy and Calcium**: A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may lead to a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer. It would be prudent to monitor and possibly limit dairy intake to mitigate this risk.

In summary, increasing folate through diet while being cautious with folic acid supplements and possibly limiting high dairy consumption may help lower the risk of prostate cancer.",83,"Are there specific dietary recommendations or restrictions that could lower my risk of prostate cancer, especially regarding folate and dairy intake?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about dietary recommendations related to prostate cancer risk, specifically focusing on folate and dairy intake.

				                    Anal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the anus.
				                    The anus is the end of the large intestine, below the rectum, through which stool (solid waste) leaves the body. The anus is formed partly from the outer skin layers of the body and partly from the intestine. Two ring-like muscles, called sphincter muscles, open and close the anal opening and let stool pass out of the body. The anal canal, the part of the anus between the rectum and the anal opening, is about 1-1 inches long.      The skin around the outside of the anus is called the perianal area. Tumors in this area are skin tumors, not anal cancer.   See the following PDQ summary for more information about anal cancer:         -  Anal Cancer Treatment
				                
				                
				                    Squamous cell carcinoma is the most common type of anal cancer.
				                    In the United States, the most common type of anal cancer is squamous cell carcinoma. Studies show that human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is the main cause of this type of anal cancer.   Another type of anal cancer, called anal adenocarcinoma, is very rare and is not discussed in this summary.
				                
				                
				                    In the United States, the number of new cases of anal cancer has increased in recent years.
				                    From 2004 to 2013, new cases of anal cancer and deaths from anal cancer increased each year. The increase in new cases was slightly higher in women and the increase in deaths from anal cancer was slightly higher in men.","Malignant cells form in the tissues of the anus, leading to anal cancer, primarily through the influence of the human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, which is the main cause of squamous cell carcinoma, the most common type of anal cancer. When HPV infects the cells in the anal region, it can cause changes in the cellular structure, leading to abnormal growth. As these cells continue to proliferate uncontrollably, they accumulate mutations that enable them to bypass normal regulatory mechanisms governing cell division and tissue homeostasis.

The cancerous process can begin with the formation of abnormal cells in the innermost lining of the anus, referred to as stage 0 (carcinoma in situ). These cells may not manifest symptoms initially but have the potential to invade surrounding tissues. If the malignant cells migrate beyond the lining, they can grow into a tumor, and if not detected and treated, this cancer can spread to nearby organs and lymph nodes, ultimately reaching other parts of the body (metastasis).

Anal tumors, although they can arise from the skin around the anus, are classified as anal cancer when they develop from the internal tissues of the anus itself, particularly the anal canal. Other factors such as a history of other cancers (like cervical or vulvar cancer), immunosuppression, and certain sexual practices can further increase the risk of developing anal cancer by promoting the persistence of HPV or weakening the body's ability to fight off infections.",598,"Can you explain the process of how malignant cells form in the tissues of the anus, specifically regarding anal cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed explanation of how malignant cells form in the tissues of the anus, emphasizing the role of HPV, which aligns with the information in the original answer about anal cancer and its common type, squamous cell carcinoma. It explores the cancerous process in a manner that complements the key points presented in the original response, maintaining a comprehensive and relevant focus on anal cancer."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the gastrointestinal tract.    - The size of the tumor.     - Whether the cancer has spread from the stomach and intestines to other parts of the body, such as the liver or lymph nodes.    - Whether the patient has carcinoid syndrome or has carcinoid heart syndrome.    - Whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery.     - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred.","The size of a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor significantly impacts both the available treatment options and the overall chances of recovery. Larger tumors often require more extensive surgical procedures, such as resection or local excision, to remove the tumor and surrounding tissues and lymph nodes if necessary. In contrast, smaller tumors may be treatable with less invasive methods, like endoscopic resection.

Additionally, the prognosis, or chance of recovery, is influenced by the tumor's size. Larger tumors, particularly those that spread to other parts of the body, have a more adverse effect on recovery chances. Other factors that contribute to prognosis include the tumor's location in the gastrointestinal tract, whether the cancer has metastasized (spread), and the ability to completely remove the tumor through surgery. Smaller, localized tumors that can be fully resected generally have a better outlook compared to larger tumors or those with metastasis.",77,How does the size of a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor impact the available treatment options and overall recovery chances?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the impact of tumor size on treatment options and recovery chances, closely aligning with the factors outlined in the original answer.

                    - There are different types of treatment for patients with parathyroid cancer.     - Treatment includes control of hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) in patients who have an overactive parathyroid gland.     - Four types of standard treatment are used:         - Surgery     - Radiation therapy      - Chemotherapy     - Supportive care        - New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.    - Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.    - Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.    - Follow-up tests may be needed.
                
                
                    There are different types of treatment for patients with parathyroid cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with parathyroid cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Treatment includes control of hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood) in patients who have an overactive parathyroid gland.
                    In order to reduce the amount of parathyroid hormone that is being made and control the level of calcium in the blood, as much of the tumor as possible is removed in surgery. For patients who cannot have surgery, medication may be used.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for parathyroid cancer that is in the parathyroid glands or has spread to other parts of the body. Because parathyroid cancer grows very slowly, cancer that has spread to other parts of the body may be removed by surgery in order to cure the patient or control the effects of the disease for a long time. Before surgery, treatment is given to control hypercalcemia.     The following surgical procedures may be used:            - En bloc resection: Surgery to remove the entire parathyroid gland and the capsule around it. Sometimes lymph nodes, half of the thyroid gland on the same side of the body as the cancer, and muscles, tissues, and a nerve in the neck are also removed.     -  Tumor debulking: A surgical procedure in which as much of the tumor as possible is removed. Some tumors cannot be completely removed.     -  Metastasectomy: Surgery to remove any cancer that has spread to distant organs such as the lung.             Surgery for parathyroid cancer sometimes damages nerves of the vocal cords. There are treatments to help with speech problems caused by this nerve damage.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat parathyroid cancer.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Supportive care     Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for hypercalcemia caused by parathyroid cancer may include the following:            -  Intravenous (IV) fluids.     - Drugs that increase how much urine the body makes.     - Drugs that stop the body from absorbing calcium from the food we eat.     - Drugs that stop the parathyroid gland from making parathyroid hormone.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   Parathyroid cancer often recurs. Patients should have regular check-ups for the rest of their lives, to find and treat recurrences early.

This therapy is particularly useful for patients who may not be candidates for surgery or in addition to surgery to target remaining cancer cells.

The two main types of radiation therapy are:

1. **External radiation therapy** - This is delivered using a machine outside the body to direct radiation toward the cancer.
2. **Internal radiation therapy** - This involves placing a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters directly into or near the cancer.",133,"How does radiation therapy work in the treatment of parathyroid cancer, and what are the two main types of this therapy?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer correctly explains how radiation therapy works in the treatment of parathyroid cancer and accurately describes the two main types of radiation therapy, matching the information provided in the original answer.

                    Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.
                    The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system located just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of semen.      As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be similar to symptoms of prostate cancer.      See the following PDQ summaries for more information about prostate cancer:         -   Prostate Cancer Prevention     -  Prostate Cancer Treatment","The symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) can mimic those of prostate cancer as both conditions may cause similar urinary issues. Common symptoms include:

- Weak or interrupted urine flow
- Sudden urge to urinate
- Frequent urination, especially at night
- Trouble starting or emptying the bladder completely
- Pain or burning while urinating
- Blood in the urine or semen

To differentiate between BPH and prostate cancer, the following steps can be taken:

1. **Consult a Doctor**: If experiencing symptoms, it is essential to seek medical advice.
2. **Physical Exam**: A doctor may perform a digital rectal exam (DRE) to check for lumps or abnormalities in the prostate.
3. **PSA Test**: Blood tests to measure prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels can help. Elevated PSA levels can indicate prostate cancer, but they can also rise in BPH and other conditions.
4. **Imaging Tests**: Procedures such as transrectal ultrasound or MRI may be conducted to view the prostate and surrounding tissues.
5. **Biopsy**: A definitive diagnosis may require a biopsy where tissue samples are taken from the prostate and examined for cancer cells.

These steps help in distinguishing whether the symptoms are due to BPH, prostate cancer, or other prostate-related conditions. Always consult healthcare providers for appropriate evaluations and diagnoses.",53,"In what ways can the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia mimic those of prostate cancer, and what steps can be taken to differentiate between the two conditions?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the similarities between the symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostate cancer, and it outlines clear steps for differentiation between the two conditions, which aligns well with the context of the original answer.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.    Studies have shown that high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not work better than standard chemotherapy in the treatment of breast cancer. Doctors have decided that, for now, high-dose chemotherapy should be tested only in clinical trials. Before taking part in such a trial, women should talk with their doctors about the serious side effects, including death, that may be caused by high-dose chemotherapy.
                
                
                    Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Some treatments for breast cancer may cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended. These are called late effects.   Late effects of radiation therapy are not common, but may include:         -  Inflammation of the lung after radiation therapy to the breast, especially when chemotherapy is given at the same time.     - Arm lymphedema, especially when radiation therapy is given after lymph node dissection.     - In women younger than 45 years who receive radiation therapy to the chest wall after mastectomy, there may be a higher risk of developing breast cancer in the other breast.        Late effects of chemotherapy depend on the drugs used, but may include:         -  Heart failure.    -  Blood clots.    -  Premature menopause.    -  Second cancer, such as leukemia.        Late effects of targeted therapy with trastuzumab, lapatinib, or pertuzumab may include:         - Heart problems such as heart failure.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a treatment approach for breast cancer that involves administering high doses of chemotherapy followed by the reinfusion of stem cells to restore the body’s blood-forming cells. The process involves several steps:

1. **Stem Cell Collection**: Stem cells, which are immature blood cells, are harvested from the patient's blood or bone marrow, or obtained from a donor. These stem cells are then frozen and stored for later use.

2. **High-Dose Chemotherapy**: The patient undergoes high-dose chemotherapy, which is intended to kill cancer cells but also destroys blood-forming cells in the bone marrow.

3. **Stem Cell Reinjection**: After the chemotherapy regimen, the frozen stem cells are thawed and reinfused into the patient’s body. These stem cells will migrate to the bone marrow and begin to grow and restore blood cell production.

Despite this intensive treatment, studies have indicated that high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant does not necessarily offer better outcomes than standard chemotherapy for breast cancer. Therefore, this treatment modality is currently only recommended to be tested in clinical trials.

**Implications of Participation:**

- **Serious Side Effects**: Patients considering this treatment need to discuss potential serious side effects with their healthcare provider. High-dose chemotherapy can lead to severe adverse effects, including the risk of mortality.

- **Clinical Trials**: Participation is limited to clinical trials at this stage, which are designed to ascertain the safety and efficacy of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplants.

- **Follow-up and Monitoring**: Close monitoring and follow-up tests are necessary to observe the effectiveness of the treatment and manage any emerging complications.

Women contemplating participation in such trials should thoroughly discuss these aspects with their healthcare providers to make informed decisions about their treatment options.",696,Can you elaborate on the process and implications of participating in high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant trials for breast cancer patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely elaborates on the process of high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant for breast cancer patients, explaining the steps involved and highlighting the serious side effects, similar to the information provided in the original answer.

                    Endometrial cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the endometrium.
                    The endometrium is the lining of the uterus. The uterus is part of the female reproductive system. It is a hollow, pear-shaped, muscular organ in the pelvis, where a fetus grows.      Cancer of the endometrium is different from cancer of the muscle of the uterus, which is called sarcoma of the uterus. See the PDQ summary on Uterine Sarcoma Treatment for more information.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about endometrial cancer:         -  Endometrial Cancer Screening     -  Endometrial Cancer Treatment
                
                
                    Endometrial cancer is the most common invasive cancer of the female reproductive system.
                    Endometrial cancer is diagnosed most often in postmenopausal women at an average age of 60 years .   From 2004 to 2013, the number of new cases of endometrial cancer increased slightly in white and African American women. From 2005 to 2014, the number of deaths from endometrial cancer also increased slightly in white and African American women. Compared with white women, rates of endometrial cancer are lower in Japanese Americans and in Latinas. The rates of endometrial cancer in white women are about the same as in African Americans or in native Hawaiians. The number of deaths from endometrial cancer is higher in African American women compared with women of other races.","From 2004 to 2014, a slight increase in the incidence and mortality rates of endometrial cancer was observed among white and African American women.

This can be a result of:                  - Early pregnancy.       - Breastfeeding.                - Getting enough exercise.     - Having any of the following procedures:                  -  Mastectomy to reduce the risk of cancer.       -  Oophorectomy to reduce the risk of cancer.       -  Ovarian ablation.,"To increase their level of exercise and help decrease the risk of breast cancer, individuals can:

- Aim for at least four or more hours of exercise per week, as studies suggest this amount of physical activity lowers the risk of breast cancer.
- Incorporate various forms of exercise into their routine, such as aerobic activities (walking, running, cycling), strength training, or group fitness classes, to enhance overall fitness and maintain a healthy weight.
- Engage in consistent physical activity, making it a regular part of their lifestyle, rather than occasional exercise.
- Focus on maintaining a healthy body weight, especially for premenopausal women, as the effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in those with normal or low body weight.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood rhabdomyosarcoma.
                    Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with rhabdomyosarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Because rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different parts of the body, many different kinds of treatments are used. Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with rhabdomyosarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric hematologist.    -  Pediatric radiologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Geneticist or cancer genetics risk counselor.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.
                
                
                    Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment for rhabdomyosarcoma may include:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma. A type of surgery called wide local excision is often done. A wide local excision is the removal of tumor and some of the tissue around it, including the lymph nodes. A second surgery may be needed to remove all the cancer. Whether surgery is done and the type of surgery done depends on the following:            - Where in the body the tumor started.      - The effect the surgery will have on the way the child will look.     - The effect the surgery will have on the child's important body functions.     - How the tumor responded to chemotherapy or radiation therapy that may have been given first.           In most children with rhabdomyosarcoma, it is not possible to remove all of the tumor by surgery.     Rhabdomyosarcoma can form in many different places in the body and the surgery will be different for each site. Surgery to treat rhabdomyosarcoma of the eye or genital areas is usually a biopsy. Chemotherapy, and sometimes radiation therapy, may be given before surgery to shrink large tumors.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients will be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Radiation therapy may also be given. Treatment given after the surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or stop them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.        -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       - Volumetrical modulated arc therapy (VMAT): VMAT is type of 3-D radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. The radiation machine moves in a circle around the patient once during treatment and sends thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) at the tumor. Treatment with VMAT is delivered faster than treatment with IMRT.       -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. It is used to treat cancer in areas such as the vagina, vulva, uterus, bladder, prostate, head, or neck. Internal radiation therapy is also called brachytherapy, internal radiation, implant radiation, or interstitial radiation therapy.           The type and amount of radiation therapy and when it is given depends on the age of the child, the type of rhabdomyosarcoma, where in the body the tumor started, how much tumor remained after surgery, and whether there is tumor in the nearby lymph nodes.     External radiation therapy is usually used to treat childhood rhabdomyosarcoma but in certain cases internal radiation therapy is used.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).    Chemotherapy may also be given to shrink the tumor before surgery in order to save as much healthy tissue as possible. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy.    Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive systemic chemotherapy to decrease the chance the cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose, and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.    See Drugs Approved for Rhabdomyosarcoma for more information.
                            
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

					                    Previously Untreated Childhood Rhabdomyosarcoma
					                    The treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma often includes surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The order that these treatments are given depends on where in the body the tumor started, the size of the tumor, the type of tumor, and whether the tumor has spread to lymph nodes or other parts of the body. See the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary for more information about surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy used to treat children with rhabdomyosarcoma.      Rhabdomyosarcoma of the brain and head and neck       - For tumors of the brain: Treatment may include surgery to remove the tumor, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are in or near the eye: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. If the tumor remains or comes back after treatment with chemotherapy and radiation therapy, surgery to remove the eye and some tissues around the eye may be needed.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull but not in or near the eye: Treatment may include radiation therapy and chemotherapy.    - For tumors of the head and neck that are not in or near the eye and not near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull: Treatment may include chemotherapy, radiation therapy, and surgery to remove the tumor.    - For tumors of the head and neck that cannot be removed by surgery: Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy including stereotactic body radiation therapy.    - For tumors of the larynx (voice box): Treatment may include chemotherapy and radiation therapy. Surgery to remove the larynx is usually not done, so that the voice is not harmed.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the arms or legs       -  Chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. If the tumor was not completely removed, a second surgery to remove the tumor may be done. Radiation therapy may also be given.    - For tumors of the hand or foot, radiation therapy and chemotherapy may be given. The tumor may not be removed because it would affect the function of the hand or foot.    -  Lymph node dissection (one or more lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer).                - For tumors in the arms, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the armpit area are removed.      - For tumors in the legs, lymph nodes near the tumor and in the groin area are removed.                    Rhabdomyosarcoma of the chest, abdomen, or pelvis       - For tumors in the chest or abdomen (including the chest wall or abdominal wall): Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given to shrink the tumor before surgery.    - For tumors of the pelvis: Surgery (wide local excision) may be done. If the tumor is large, chemotherapy is given to shrink the tumor before surgery. Radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - For tumors of the diaphragm: A biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy to shrink the tumor. Surgery may be done later to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - For tumors of the gallbladder or bile ducts: A biopsy of the tumor is followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.    - For tumors of the muscles or tissues around the anus or between the vulva and the anus or the scrotum and the anus: Surgery is done to remove as much of the tumor as possible and some nearby lymph nodes, followed by chemotherapy and radiation therapy.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the kidney       - For tumors of the kidney: Surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Chemotherapy and radiation therapy may also be given.           Rhabdomyosarcoma of the bladder and prostate       - For tumors that are only at the top of the bladder: Surgery (wide local excision) is done.    - For tumors of the prostate or bladder (other than the top of the bladder):                -  Chemotherapy and radiation therapy are given first to shrink the tumor. If cancer cells remain after chemotherapy and radiation therapy, the tumor is removed by surgery. Surgery may include removal of the prostate, part of the bladder, or pelvic exenteration without removal of the rectum. (This may include removal of the lower colon and bladder. In girls, the cervix, vagina, ovaries, and nearby lymph nodes may be removed).      - Chemotherapy is given first to shrink the tumor. Surgery to remove the tumor, but not the bladder or prostate, is done. Internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.                    Rhabdomyosarcoma of the area near the testicles       -  Surgery to remove the testicle and spermatic cord. The lymph nodes in the back of the abdomen may be checked for cancer, especially if the lymph nodes are large or the child is 10 years or older.     -  Radiation therapy may be given if the tumor cannot be completely removed by surgery.            Rhabdomyosarcoma of the vulva, vagina, uterus, cervix, or ovary       - For tumors of the vulva and vagina: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove the tumor. Internal or external radiation therapy may be given after surgery.    - For tumors of the uterus: Treatment may include chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. Sometimes surgery may be needed to remove any remaining cancer cells.    - For tumors of the cervix: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.    - For tumors of the ovary: Treatment may include chemotherapy followed by surgery to remove any remaining tumor.          Metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma     Treatment, such as chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or surgery to remove the tumor, is given to the site where the tumor first formed. If the cancer has spread to the brain, spinal cord, or lungs, radiation therapy may also be given to the sites where the cancer has spread.   The following treatment is being studied for metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma:          - A clinical trial of immunotherapy (vaccine therapy).

                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biologic therapy or biotherapy.    There are different types of immunotherapy:            -  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy uses the body's immune system to kill cancer cells. Two types of immune checkpoint inhibitors are being studied in the treatment of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma that has come back after treatment:                  -  CTLA-4 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.       -  PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Nivolumab and pembrolizumab are PD-1 inhibitors.                -  Vaccine therapy is a type of immunotherapy being studied to treat metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma.              Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do. There are different types of targeted therapy:            -  mTOR inhibitors stop the protein that helps cells divide and survive. Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are small-molecule drugs that go through the cell membrane and work inside cancer cells to block signals that cancer cells need to grow and divide. MK-1775 is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.     -  Antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied in the treatment of recurrent rhabdomyosarcoma.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","The goals of using high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant for children with rhabdomyosarcoma are to effectively administer high doses of chemotherapy to kill cancer cells and to replace blood-forming cells that may have been destroyed by the treatment. The expected outcomes include a potential increase in the efficacy of treatment compared to standard dosages, reduced chances of cancer recurrence, and restoration of the body's blood cells through the infusion of previously harvested stem cells. This treatment approach may be especially considered in clinical trials to assess its effectiveness in treating recurrent or progressive cases of rhabdomyosarcoma.",564,What are the goals and expected outcomes of using high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant for children with rhabdomyosarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the original answer's discussion on high-dose chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant for children with rhabdomyosarcoma.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.
                    Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:
                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.   The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent skin cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI Web site. Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for nonmelanoma skin cancer prevention trials and melanoma prevention trials that are now accepting patients.","Recent research comparing the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents like nicotinamide and celecoxib for preventing nonmelanoma skin cancers shows varying results. 

- **Celecoxib**: In a study focused on patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer, those who took celecoxib exhibited slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. However, celecoxib can lead to serious side effects, especially relating to the heart and blood vessels.

- **Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)**: Studies have indicated that nicotinamide helps prevent new actinic keratosis lesions in individuals who had four or fewer such lesions prior to treatment. However, further studies are necessary to determine if it significantly prevents the formation or recurrence of nonmelanoma skin cancer.

Overall, while both agents show promise, celecoxib has evidence of reducing recurrence in certain patients, whereas the effectiveness of nicotinamide in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancer remains inconclusive pending more research.",206,How do chemopreventive agents like nicotinamide and celecoxib compare in their effectiveness for preventing nonmelanoma skin cancers based on recent research?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the effectiveness of chemopreventive agents nicotinamide and celecoxib in preventing nonmelanoma skin cancers, which is aligned with the relevant information presented in the original answer. It discusses specific studies and their findings, accurately reflecting the content regarding both agents while providing a comparative analysis as requested in the question."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether the tumor is a low-grade or high-grade astrocytoma.    - Where the tumor has formed in the CNS and if it has spread to nearby tissue or to other parts of the body.    - How fast the tumor is growing.    - The child's age.    - Whether cancer cells remain after surgery.    - Whether there are changes in certain genes.    - Whether the child has NF1 or tuberous sclerosis.    - Whether the child has diencephalic syndrome (a condition which slows physical growth).    - Whether the child has intracranial hypertension (cerebrospinal fluid pressure within the skull is high) at the time of diagnosis.    - Whether the astrocytoma has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        For recurrent astrocytoma, prognosis and treatment depend on how much time passed between the time treatment ended and the time the astrocytoma recurred.","The presence of genetic changes can significantly impact the prognosis and treatment plan for children with astrocytomas. Specifically, certain genetic alterations may indicate a more aggressive tumor type or could reflect how well the tumor may respond to specific treatments. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options are influenced by factors such as whether the tumor is classified as low-grade or high-grade, the specific genetic changes present, and whether cancer cells remain after surgery.

For instance, children diagnosed with high-grade astrocytomas generally have a poorer prognosis compared to those with low-grade tumors, and the presence of specific genetic changes can further influence treatment choices. Additionally, children with certain genetic disorders, like neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), may have differing treatment pathways or outcomes when compared to those without such genetic backgrounds. The identification of genetic changes helps healthcare providers tailor the treatment approach and manage the child's care more effectively.",282,How does the presence of genetic changes impact the prognosis and treatment plan for children with astrocytomas?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely aligns with the original answer by discussing how genetic changes impact prognosis and treatment plans for children with astrocytomas. It explicitly mentions the influence of genetic alterations on tumor aggressiveness and treatment responses, which were key factors listed in the original answer. Additionally, it discusses the relevance of tumor classification and the presence of residual cancer cells, further reinforcing its relevance to the original content."
"Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage lip and oral cavity cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam of the lips and oral cavity: An exam to check the lips and oral cavity for abnormal areas. The medical doctor or dentist will feel the entire inside of the mouth with a gloved finger and examine the oral cavity with a small long-handled mirror and lights. This will include checking the insides of the cheeks and lips; the gums; the roof and floor of the mouth; and the top, bottom, and sides of the tongue. The neck will be felt for swollen lymph nodes. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and medical and dental treatments will also be taken.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. If leukoplakia is found, cells taken from the patches are also checked under the microscope for signs of cancer.     -  Exfoliative cytology : A procedure to collect cells from the lip or oral cavity. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the lips, tongue, mouth, or throat. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   Barium swallow : A series of x-rays of the esophagus and stomach. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus and x-rays are taken. This procedure is also called an upper GI series.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.","The endoscopy procedure involves the use of an endoscope, which is a thin, tube-like instrument equipped with a light and a lens for viewing. During this procedure, an endoscope is inserted through an opening in the body, such as the mouth, to examine organs and tissues inside the body for abnormal areas. 

In the context of diagnosing lip and oral cavity cancer, endoscopy aids in identifying suspicious lesions or abnormalities in the mouth and throat that may indicate the presence of malignant cells. It can also enable the collection of tissue or lymph node samples for biopsy, allowing for further investigation under a microscope for signs of cancer. This process is crucial for detecting, diagnosing, and staging lip and oral cavity cancer, thereby informing the appropriate treatment options.",392,Can you explain the endoscopy procedure and how it aids in diagnosing lip and oral cavity cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the endoscopy procedure and its relevance in diagnosing lip and oral cavity cancer.

"Being older and having fair skin may increase the risk of intraocular melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Risk factors for intraocular melanoma include the following:         - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.      - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.             - Older age.    - Being white.","If someone believes they possess risk factors for intraocular melanoma, they should take the following steps:

1. **Consult with a Doctor**: Discuss any concerns about risk factors with a healthcare professional to evaluate personal risk and possible need for screening.

2. **Monitor for Symptoms**: Be aware of signs such as blurred vision, dark spots on the iris, floaters, flashes of light, changes in pupil size or shape, and changes in the position of the eyeball.

3. **Regular Eye Exams**: Schedule comprehensive eye exams, particularly if they have fair skin, light-colored eyes, or are of older age, as these factors increase risk.

4. **Discuss Follow-up Testing**: Based on personal risk factors and any symptoms, follow up with the appropriate tests that examine the eye to aid in detection, as recommended by a doctor.",170,What steps should someone take if they believe they possess risk factors for intraocular melanoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides specific, actionable steps for individuals who believe they have risk factors for intraocular melanoma, aligning well with the original answer's focus on risk factors and the importance of consulting with a doctor.

Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of Ewing sarcoma that has recurred.

                    - Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).    - Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.    - Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL.    - Signs and symptoms of adult ALL include fever, feeling tired, and easy bruising or bleeding.     - Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult ALL.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes too many lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell).
                    Adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL; also called acute lymphocytic leukemia) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated.
                
                
                    Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell.   A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:          -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.    -  Granulocytes (white blood cells) that fight infection and disease.         A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast cell and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In ALL, too many stem cells become lymphoblasts, B lymphocytes, or T lymphocytes. These cells are also called leukemia cells. These leukemia cells are not able to fight infection very well. Also, as the number of leukemia cells increases in the blood and bone marrow, there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. This may cause infection, anemia, and easy bleeding. The cancer can also spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).     This summary is about adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia:          -  Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia Treatment.    -  Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment.    -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment.    -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment.    -  Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment.","Individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) may experience a range of symptoms that significantly impact their overall health. Common symptoms include:

- **Fever**
- **Feeling tired or weak**

- **Petechiae** (flat, pinpoint spots under the skin caused by bleeding)
- **Shortness of breath**
- **Weight loss or loss of appetite**
- **Bone or stomach pain**
- **Painless lumps** in the neck, underarm, stomach, or groin
- **Night sweats**
- **Frequent infections**

These symptoms can lead to severe health complications. For instance, weakness and fatigue can inhibit daily activities and overall quality of life. Easy bruising or bleeding increases the risk of hemorrhage, while frequent infections indicate a weakened immune system due to the lack of functional white blood cells. Additionally, the presence of significant symptoms such as fever and weight loss may indicate the disease's progression, necessitating immediate medical intervention. Overall, these symptoms affect not only the physical health of individuals but also their emotional and psychological well-being.",634,"What are the common symptoms that individuals with adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia may experience, and how do these symptoms impact their overall health?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes the common symptoms of adult acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) as mentioned in the original answer.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -  Eye exam: An exam to check vision and the general health of the eyes.    -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Blood chemistry study : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as glucose (sugar), released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -  Blood tests: Tests to measure the levels of testosterone or estrogen in the blood.

This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.       Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following are risk factors for lung cancer:
                    Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking      Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.    Studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer.     Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke.       Secondhand smoke    Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking.       Family history    Having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. Because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke, it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.       HIV infection    Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.        Environmental risk factors            -   Radiation exposure: Being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. Atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon are sources of radiation exposure:                   - Atomic bomb radiation: Being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer.       - Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers, including breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses x-rays, gamma rays, or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. The higher the dose of radiation received, the higher the risk. The risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers.       - Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT scans, expose patients to radiation. Low-dose spiral CT scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose CT scans. In lung cancer screening, the use of low-dose spiral CT scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation.       - Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up over time.             Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. In people who have never smoked, about 30% of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon.     -  Workplace exposure: Studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer:                  -  Asbestos.       -  Arsenic.       - Chromium.       - Nickel.       - Beryllium.       -  Cadmium.       - Tar and soot.            These substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. As the level of exposure to these substances increases, the risk of lung cancer also increases. The risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke.      -  Air pollution: Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer.              Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers    Taking beta carotene supplements (pills) increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. The risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day.
                
                
                    The following are protective factors for lung cancer:
                    Not smoking    The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke.       Quitting smoking    Smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. In smokers who have been treated for lung cancer, quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. Counseling, the use of nicotine replacement products, and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good.    In a person who has quit smoking, the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. After a person has quit smoking for 10 years, the risk of lung cancer decreases 30% to 50%.    See the following for more information on quitting smoking:            -  Tobacco (includes help with quitting)     -  Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit               Lower exposure to workplace risk factors     Laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. Laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.       Lower exposure to radon     Lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers. High levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage, such as sealing basements.
                
                
                    It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer:
                    Diet     Some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. However, since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers, it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking.       Physical activity    Some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. However, since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers, it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer:
                    Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers    Studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer.       Vitamin E supplements      Studies show that taking vitamin E supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials for prevention trials for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer that are now accepting patients. These include trials for quitting smoking.","To reduce the risk factors associated with lung cancer, effective methods include:

1. **Not Smoking**: The best way to prevent lung cancer is to avoid smoking cigarettes, cigars, and pipes entirely.

2. **Quitting Smoking**: For those who currently smoke, quitting can significantly decrease the risk of lung cancer. Support programs, nicotine replacement therapies, and counseling can assist in quitting.

3. **Avoiding Secondhand Smoke**: Limiting exposure to secondhand smoke from others is crucial since it also increases the risk of lung cancer.

4. **Lower Exposure to Environmental Risk Factors**: 
   - Reduce exposure to harmful substances in the workplace, such as asbestos, arsenic, chromium, nickel, beryllium, cadmium, and tar.
   - Implement measures to lower radon levels in homes, especially in areas known for high radon exposure.

5. **Healthy Lifestyle Choices**: While the effects of diet and physical activity on lung cancer risk are not fully established, maintaining a healthy diet rich in fruits and vegetables and regular physical activity may be beneficial.

By implementing these methods, individuals can help reduce their overall risk of developing lung cancer.",51,What are some effective methods to reduce the risk factors associated with lung cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about effective methods to reduce risk factors associated with lung cancer, mirroring the key points from the original answer.

                    After parathyroid cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The following imaging tests may be used to determine if cancer has spread to other parts of the body such as the lungs, liver, bone, heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if parathyroid cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually parathyroid cancer cells. The disease is metastatic parathyroid cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    There is no standard staging process for parathyroid cancer.
                    Parathyroid cancer is described as either localized or metastatic:         - Localized parathyroid cancer is found in a parathyroid gland and may have spread to nearby tissues.    - Metastatic parathyroid cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bone, sac around the heart, pancreas, or lymph nodes.","Understanding metastasis is crucial when diagnosing and treating parathyroid cancer because it significantly impacts both the staging of the cancer and the choice of treatment options. Since parathyroid cancer can be localized within the parathyroid gland or metastatic—having spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or lymph nodes—staging is essential for determining the progression of the disease and the prognosis.

When cancer is detected, various tests, including imaging scans, are employed to assess whether cancer cells have metastasized. If the cancer is metastatic, this influences the treatment strategy, as indicated in the context where treatment options differ for localized versus metastatic parathyroid cancer. For example, surgery might still be an option for metastatic cases, where the goal could be to remove tumors that have spread.

Moreover, the prognosis for patients with metastatic parathyroid cancer is typically poorer compared to those with localized disease, indicating a need for a tailored approach to treatment that may involve more aggressive therapies and closer monitoring for potential recurrences after treatment. Therefore, understanding the extent of metastasis helps guide not only the diagnostic process but also the effective management of parathyroid cancer.",132,Could you elaborate on the importance of understanding metastasis when diagnosing and treating parathyroid cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides an in-depth explanation of the importance of understanding metastasis in the context of diagnosing and treating parathyroid cancer.

                    Colon cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the colon.
                    The colon is part of the bodys digestive system. The digestive system removes and processes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from foods and helps pass waste material out of the body. The digestive system is made up of the esophagus, stomach, and the small and large intestines. The colon (large bowel) is the first part of the large intestine and is about 5 feet long. Together, the rectum and anal canal make up the last part of the large intestine and are about 6-8 inches long. The anal canal ends at the anus (the opening of the large intestine to the outside of the body).      Gastrointestinal stromal tumors can occur in the colon. See the PDQ summary on Gastrointestinal Stromal Tumors Treatment for more information.    See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for information about colorectal cancer in children.","The colon is a crucial component of the digestive system, playing a key role in processing nutrients and eliminating waste. It is about 5 feet long and is part of the large intestine, which is made up of various sections including the colon, rectum, and anal canal (the latter two totaling about 6-8 inches). The colon is responsible for absorbing water and salts from the remaining indigestible food matter and compacts the waste into stool.

In relation to colon cancer, this disease is characterized by the formation of malignant cells in the colon's tissues. Various factors, such as health history and changes in bowel habits, can affect the risk and prognosis of developing colon cancer. Symptoms may include blood in the stool and significant changes in bowel habits, highlighting the importance of early detection.

                    Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph tissue of the brain and/or spinal cord.
                    Lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system. The lymph system is part of the immune system and is made up of the lymph, lymph vessels, lymph nodes, spleen, thymus, tonsils, and bone marrow. Lymphocytes (carried in the lymph) travel in and out of the central nervous system (CNS). It is thought that some of these lymphocytes become malignant and cause lymphoma to form in the CNS. Primary CNS lymphoma can start in the brain, spinal cord, or meninges (the layers that form the outer covering of the brain). Because the eye is so close to the brain, primary CNS lymphoma can also start in the eye (called ocular lymphoma).","Primary CNS lymphoma is diagnosed through various tests that examine the eyes, brain, and spinal cord. Key diagnostic procedures include:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: This involves a comprehensive examination of the body and health history to identify any unusual signs or symptoms.

2. **Neurological Exam**: A series of assessments aimed at evaluating brain, spinal cord, and nerve function, including mental status, coordination, and reflexes.

3. **Slit-lamp Eye Exam**: Utilizes a specialized microscope to inspect the internal and external structures of the eye for signs of lymphoma.

4. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: A detailed imaging technique that uses magnets and radio waves to create images of the brain and spinal cord. A contrast substance (gadolinium) is injected to enhance visibility of cancer cells.

5. **PET Scan**: This imaging test involves a small amount of radioactive glucose to identify malignant tumor cells, which absorb more glucose than normal cells.

6. **Lumbar Puncture (Spinal Tap)**: A procedure to collect cerebrospinal fluid from the spinal column, allowing for microscopic examination for tumor cells and analysis of protein and glucose levels.

7. **Stereotactic Biopsy**: Employs 3D imaging to guide tissue sampling from the tumor site for microscopic evaluation.

Further laboratory tests may be performed on the collected tissue samples, including flow cytometry, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic analysis, and complete blood count. These tests help confirm the diagnosis and provide insight into the specific characteristics of the lymphoma.",433,"Can you explain how primary CNS lymphoma is diagnosed through specific tests involving the eyes, brain, and spinal cord?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the question about how primary CNS lymphoma is diagnosed through specific tests related to the eyes, brain, and spinal cord.

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). Treatment for AT/RT is usually within a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with central nervous system cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:          -  Pediatrician.    - Pediatric neurosurgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Geneticist or genetic counselor.
                
                
                    Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Four types of treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is used to diagnose and treat CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. See the General Information section of this summary.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, most patients will be given chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.             - When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. Anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.     - When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). High doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor.              Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread. External radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord.     Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children.        High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.

                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.    Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    After rectal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the rectum or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps (small pieces of bulging tissue). abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, pelvis, or chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   Endorectal ultrasound : A procedure used to examine the rectum and nearby organs. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the rectum and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram. This procedure is also called transrectal ultrasound.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if rectal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rectal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic rectal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for rectal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)      In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I      In stage I, cancer has formed in the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall and has spread to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). Cancer may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall.        Stage II      Stage II rectal cancer is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC.            - Stage IIA: Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall.      - Stage IIB: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs.      - Stage IIC: Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall to nearby organs.               Stage III     Stage III rectal cancer is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.     In stage IIIA:            -  Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall. Cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa). Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes.             In stage IIIB:            - Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but not to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to at least one but not more than 3 nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes; or      - Cancer has spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall or to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall. Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or      - Cancer has spread through the mucosa (innermost layer) of the rectum wall to the submucosa (layer of tissue under the mucosa) and may have spread to the muscle layer of the rectum wall. Cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes.            In stage IIIC:            - Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall but has not spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to at least 4 but not more than 6 nearby lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread through the muscle layer of the rectum wall to the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall or has spread through the serosa but has not spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to 7 or more nearby lymph nodes; or      - Cancer has spread through the serosa (outermost layer) of the rectum wall and has spread to nearby organs. Cancer has spread to one or more nearby lymph nodes or cancer cells have formed in tissues near the lymph nodes.              Stage IV     Stage IV rectal cancer is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.             - Stage IVA: Cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. Cancer has spread to one organ that is not near the rectum, such as the liver, lung, or ovary, or to a distant lymph node.      - Stage IVB: Cancer may have spread through the rectum wall and may have spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes. Cancer has spread to more than one organ that is not near the rectum or into the lining of the abdominal wall.","The diagnostic tests commonly performed to determine the stage of rectal cancer after diagnosis include:

1. **Chest x-ray**: This x-ray examines the organs and bones in the chest to see if cancer has spread.
2. **Colonoscopy**: This procedure allows a doctor to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer.

"Smoking or being infected with human papillomavirus can increase the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.   The most common risk factors for oropharyngeal cancer include the following:         - A history of smoking cigarettes for more than 10 pack years and other tobacco use.    - Personal history of head and neck cancer.    - Heavy alcohol use.    - Being infected with human papillomavirus (HPV), especially HPV type 16. The number of cases of oropharyngeal cancers linked to HPV infection is increasing.    - Chewing betel quid, a stimulant commonly used in parts of Asia.","Heavy alcohol consumption is connected to the risk of developing oropharyngeal cancer as it is considered an important risk factor for this type of cancer. The risk of oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. Specifically, individuals who consume 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day have about twice the risk compared to non-drinkers, while those who consume 5 or more drinks per day have a risk that is 5 times higher than that of non-drinkers. Additionally, the use of alcohol combined with tobacco can further elevate the risk, with the risk being 2 to 3 times higher for those who use both substances compared to those who use either one alone.",328,How is heavy alcohol consumption connected to the risk of developing oropharyngeal cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the original answer's discussion of heavy alcohol consumption as a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.

                    The following risk factors increase the risk of endometrial cancer:
                    Endometrial hyperplasia     Endometrial hyperplasia is an abnormal thickening of the endometrium (lining of the uterus). It is not cancer, but in some cases, it may lead to endometrial cancer.        Estrogen     Estrogen is a hormone made by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Estrogen can affect the growth of some cancers, including endometrial cancer.     A woman's risk of developing endometrial cancer is increased by being exposed to estrogen in the following ways:            - Estrogen-only hormone replacement therapy: Estrogen may be given to replace the estrogen no longer produced by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women whose ovaries have been removed. This is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT), or hormone therapy (HT). The use of HRT that contains only estrogen increases the risk of endometrial cancer and endometrial hyperplasia. For this reason, estrogen therapy alone is usually prescribed only for women who do not have a uterus. HRT that contains only estrogen also increases the risk of stroke and blood clots. When estrogen is combined with progestin (another hormone), it is called combination estrogen-progestin replacement therapy. For postmenopausal women, taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not increase the risk of endometrial cancer, but it does increase the risk of breast cancer. (See the Breast Cancer Prevention summary for more information.)     - Early menstruation: Beginning to have menstrual periods at an early age increases the number of years the body is exposed to estrogen and increases a woman's risk of endometrial cancer.     - Late menopause: Women who reach menopause at an older age are exposed to estrogen for a longer time and have an increased risk of endometrial cancer.     - Never being pregnant: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for a longer time than women who have been pregnant. This increases the risk of endometrial cancer.               Tamoxifen     Tamoxifen is one of a group of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators, or SERMs. Tamoxifen acts like estrogen on some tissues in the body, such as the uterus, but blocks the effects of estrogen on other tissues, such as the breast. Tamoxifen is used to prevent breast cancer in women who are at high risk for the disease. However, using tamoxifen for more than 2 years increases the risk of endometrial cancer. This risk is greater in postmenopausal women.      Raloxifene is a SERM that is used to prevent bone weakness in postmenopausal women. However, it does not have estrogen-like effects on the uterus and has not been shown to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.        Obesity, weight gain, metabolic syndrome, and diabetes     Obesity, gaining weight as an adult, or having metabolic syndrome increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Obesity is related to other risk factors such as high estrogen levels, having extra fat around the waist, polycystic ovary syndrome, and lack of physical activity.    Having metabolic syndrome increases the risk of endometrial cancer. Metabolic syndrome is a condition that includes extra fat around the waist, high blood sugar, high blood pressure, and high levels of triglycerides (a type of fat) in the blood.        Genetic factors     Hereditary nonpolyposis colon cancer (HNPCC) syndrome (also known as Lynch Syndrome) is an inherited disorder caused by changes in certain genes. Women who have HNPCC syndrome have a much higher risk of developing endometrial cancer than women who do not have HNPCC syndrome.    Polycystic ovary syndrome (a disorder of the hormones made by the ovaries), and Cowden syndrome are inherited conditions that are linked to an increased risk of endometrial cancer.    Women with a family history of endometrial cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) are also at increased risk of endometrial cancer.
                
                
                    The following protective factors decrease the risk of endometrial cancer:
                    Pregnancy and breast-feeding    Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy and when breast-feeding. The risk of endometrial cancer is lower in women who have had children. Breastfeeding for more than 18 months also decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.       Combination oral contraceptives    Taking contraceptives that combine estrogen and progestin (combination oral contraceptives) decreases the risk of endometrial cancer. The protective effect of combination oral contraceptives increases with the length of time they are used, and can last for many years after oral contraceptive use has been stopped.    While taking oral contraceptives, women have a higher risk of blood clots, stroke, and heart attack, especially women who smoke and are older than 35 years.       Physical activity    Physical activity at home (exercise) or on the job may lower the risk of endometrial cancer.        Cigarette smoking     Smoking at least 20 cigarettes a day may lower the risk of endometrial cancer. The risk of endometrial cancer is even lower in postmenopausal women who smoke.    However, there are many proven harms of smoking. Cigarette smokers live about 10 years less than nonsmokers. Cigarette smokers also have an increased risk of the following:            - Heart disease.     -  Head and neck cancers.     -  Lung cancer.     -  Bladder cancer.     -  Pancreatic cancer.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following factors affect the risk of endometrial cancer:
                    Weight loss    It is not known if losing weight decreases the risk of endometrial cancer.       Fruits, vegetables, and vitamins    A diet that includes, fruits, vegetables, phytoestrogen, soy, and vitamin D has not been found to affect the risk of endometrial cancer.     Taking multivitamins has little or no effect on the risk of common cancers, including endometrial cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

                    Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.
                    Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:
                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.

                    Childhood astrocytoma is a disease in which benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the brain.
                    Astrocytomas are tumors that start in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells hold nerve cells in place, bring food and oxygen to them, and help protect them from disease, such as infection. Gliomas are tumors that form from glial cells. An astrocytoma is a type of glioma.   Astrocytoma is the most common type of glioma diagnosed in children. It can form anywhere in the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord).    This summary is about the treatment of tumors that begin in astrocytes in the brain (primary brain tumors). Metastatic brain tumors are formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain. Treatment of metastatic brain tumors is not discussed here.    Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of brain tumors in children and adults:          -  Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview     -  Adult Central Nervous System Tumors Treatment
                
                
                    Astrocytomas may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer).
                    Benign brain tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues. Malignant brain tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue. When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors can cause signs and symptoms and almost all need treatment.
                
                
                    The central nervous system controls many important body functions.
                    Astrocytomas are most common in these parts of the central nervous system (CNS):         -   Cerebrum : The largest part of the brain, at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem-solving, speech, emotions, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.     -   Cerebellum : The lower, back part of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). The cerebellum controls movement, balance, and posture.    -   Brain stem : The part that connects the brain to the spinal cord, in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used in seeing, hearing, walking, talking, and eating.     -   Hypothalamus : The area in the middle of the base of the brain. It controls body temperature, hunger, and thirst.    -  Visual pathway: The group of nerves that connect the eye with the brain.    -  Spinal cord: The column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. The spinal cord and membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.","The location of an astrocytoma within the central nervous system (CNS) significantly influences the symptoms a child may experience. This is because different parts of the brain and spinal cord control various functions within the body. 

For example, if an astrocytoma forms in a region responsible for motor functions, the child might exhibit weakness or loss of coordination. Likewise, if the tumor is located in an area that impacts vision, the child may experience visual disturbances. Symptoms can also vary based on the size of the tumor, as larger tumors may create more significant pressure on surrounding brain structures, leading to headaches, nausea, or vomiting. 

Ultimately, the specific symptoms depend on where the tumor is positioned, its size, and the functions of the affected brain regions, highlighting the tailored approach needed for diagnosis and treatment based on the tumor’s location.",277,Can you explain how the location of an astrocytoma within the central nervous system influences the symptoms a child may experience?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of an astrocytoma's location within the central nervous system on the symptoms a child may experience. It elaborates on how specific brain regions are responsible for different functions, which aligns with the original answer's mention of the central nervous system's role in controlling various body functions. Furthermore, it emphasizes the variability of symptoms based on tumor size and location, which is consistent with the original points about the signs and symptoms of astrocytomas not being the same in every child."

                    Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors form in hormone-making cells (islet cells) of the pancreas.
                    The pancreas is a gland about 6 inches long that is shaped like a thin pear lying on its side. The wider end of the pancreas is called the head, the middle section is called the body, and the narrow end is called the tail. The pancreas lies behind the stomach and in front of the spine.      There are two kinds of cells in the pancreas:         -   Endocrine pancreas cells  make several kinds of hormones (chemicals that control the actions of certain cells or organs in the body), such as insulin to control blood sugar. They cluster together in many small groups (islets) throughout the pancreas. Endocrine pancreas cells are also called islet cells or islets of Langerhans. Tumors that form in islet cells are called islet cell tumors, pancreatic endocrine tumors, or pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (pancreatic NETs).     -   Exocrine pancreas cells  make enzymes that are released into the small intestine to help the body digest food. Most of the pancreas is made of ducts with small sacs at the end of the ducts, which are lined with exocrine cells.         This summary discusses islet cell tumors of the endocrine pancreas. See the PDQ summary on Pancreatic Cancer Treatment for information on exocrine pancreatic cancer.    Pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) may be benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer). When pancreatic NETs are malignant, they are called pancreatic endocrine cancer or islet cell carcinoma.   Pancreatic NETs are much less common than pancreatic exocrine tumors and have a better prognosis.
                
                
                    There are different kinds of functional pancreatic NETs.
                    Pancreatic NETs make different kinds of hormones such as gastrin, insulin, and glucagon. Functional pancreatic NETs include the following:         -   Gastrinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make gastrin. Gastrin is a hormone that causes the stomach to release an acid that helps digest food. Both gastrin and stomach acid are increased by gastrinomas. When increased stomach acid, stomach ulcers, and diarrhea are caused by a tumor that makes gastrin, it is called Zollinger-Ellison syndrome. A gastrinoma usually forms in the head of the pancreas and sometimes forms in the small intestine. Most gastrinomas are malignant (cancer).    -   Insulinoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make insulin. Insulin is a hormone that controls the amount of glucose (sugar) in the blood. It moves glucose into the cells, where it can be used by the body for energy. Insulinomas are usually slow-growing tumors that rarely spread. An insulinoma forms in the head, body, or tail of the pancreas. Insulinomas are usually benign (not cancer).    -   Glucagonoma: A tumor that forms in cells that make glucagon. Glucagon is a hormone that increases the amount of glucose in the blood. It causes the liver to break down glycogen. Too much glucagon causes hyperglycemia (high blood sugar). A glucagonoma usually forms in the tail of the pancreas. Most glucagonomas are malignant (cancer).    -  Other types of tumors: There are other rare types of functional pancreatic NETs that make hormones, including hormones that control the balance of sugar, salt, and water in the body. These tumors include:                - VIPomas, which make vasoactive intestinal peptide. VIPoma may also be called Verner-Morrison syndrome.      - Somatostatinomas, which make somatostatin.         These other types of tumors are grouped together because they are treated in much the same way.","The main types of functional pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs) and the hormones they produce are:

1. **Gastrinoma**: This tumor forms in cells that produce gastrin, which stimulates the stomach to release acid for digestion. Gastrinomas can lead to Zollinger-Ellison syndrome, characterized by increased stomach acid, ulcers, and diarrhea.

2. **Insulinoma**: This tumor forms in cells that produce insulin, a hormone that regulates blood glucose levels by facilitating the uptake of glucose into cells. Insulinomas are typically slow-growing and usually benign.

3. **Glucagonoma**: This type of tumor arises from cells producing glucagon, which raises blood glucose levels by prompting the liver to break down glycogen. Excess glucagon results in hyperglycemia.

4. **VIPomas**: These tumors produce vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), leading to significant fluid loss and electrolyte imbalances.

5. **Somatostatinomas**: These tumors generate somatostatin, a hormone that inhibits the release of several other hormones, including insulin and glucagon.

                    Metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary is a disease in which squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck and it is not known where the cancer first formed in the body.
                    Squamous cells are thin, flat cells found in tissues that form the surface of the skin and the lining of body cavities such as the mouth, hollow organs such as the uterus and blood vessels, and the lining of the respiratory (breathing) and digestive tracts. Some organs with squamous cells are the esophagus, lungs, kidneys, and uterus. Cancer can begin in squamous cells anywhere in the body and metastasize (spread) through the blood or lymph system to other parts of the body.    When squamous cell cancer spreads to lymph nodes in the neck or around the collarbone, it is called metastatic squamous neck cancer. The doctor will try to find the primary tumor (the cancer that first formed in the body), because treatment for metastatic cancer is the same as treatment for the primary tumor. For example, when lung cancer spreads to the neck, the cancer cells in the neck are lung cancer cells and they are treated the same as the cancer in the lung. Sometimes doctors cannot find where in the body the cancer first began to grow. When tests cannot find a primary tumor, it is called an occult (hidden) primary tumor. In many cases, the primary tumor is never found.","Healthcare professionals determine the primary tumor location in cases of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary through a series of tests that examine the tissues of the neck, respiratory tract, and upper part of the digestive tract. The specific tests utilized for this purpose include:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: A thorough examination of the body, particularly the head and neck, to look for signs of disease such as lumps.

2. **Biopsy**: This involves the removal of cells or tissues for microscopic examination to check for cancer. Types of biopsies that may be done include:
   - **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy**: Uses a thin needle to remove tissue or fluid.
   - **Core needle biopsy**: Uses a wide needle to remove larger tissue samples.
   - **Excisional biopsy**: Involves the removal of an entire lump of tissue.

3. **Endoscopy**: This procedure involves using a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and lens to look at the organs and tissues inside the body and to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples.

4. **Imaging Tests**: These include:
   - **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Provides detailed pictures of areas inside the body.
   - **CT scan (Computed Tomography)**: Creates cross-sectional images of the body from different angles to help identify abnormalities.
   - **PET scan (Positron Emission Tomography)**: Detects malignant tumor cells by showing areas of high glucose uptake associated with active cancer cells.

5. **Laboratory Tests**: These may include immunohistochemistry, light and electron microscopy, and specific viral tests (for EBV and HPV) performed on tissue samples.

The diagnosis of an occult primary tumor is confirmed when the primary tumor cannot be identified despite the above testing procedures.",270,"How do healthcare professionals determine the primary tumor location when diagnosing metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary, and what specific tests are utilized for this purpose?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the original query by detailing how healthcare professionals determine the primary tumor's location in cases of metastatic squamous neck cancer with occult primary.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Proton beam radiation therapy     Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.        Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.    Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include the following:            -  Dendritic cell vaccine therapy.     -  Gene therapy.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","Participation in clinical trials contributes to the advancement of cancer treatment for adult central nervous system tumors in several important ways:

1. **Testing New Treatments**: Clinical trials are designed to research and evaluate new treatments, which may include novel drugs or therapy approaches, such as proton beam radiation therapy and biologic therapy. These trials aim to determine if these new methods are safer, more effective, or better than current standard treatments.

2. **Improving Standard Treatments**: Many of today’s standard cancer treatments are based on data obtained from earlier clinical trials. When a clinical trial demonstrates that a new treatment is superior to the existing standard, that new treatment can be adopted as the new standard of care.

3. **Giving Patients Access to Innovative Options**: By participating in a clinical trial, patients may receive cutting-edge treatments that are not yet widely available, potentially offering them additional options when standard treatments may not be effective.

4. **Contributing to Research and Future Treatments**: Participants in clinical trials help gather critical data that can advance the understanding of cancer and lead to improvements in treatment approaches in the future. This includes not only successful outcomes but also responses to treatments that did not yield positive results, which are essential for progressing cancer research.

5. **Identifying Effective Treatment Regimens**: Trials may test different combinations of therapies to find the most effective regimens for specific tumor types. Through this testing, future treatment protocols can be developed that optimize patient outcomes.

In summary, participation in clinical trials is a vital component of cancer treatment development, leading to potential improvements in recovery outcomes and offering patients advanced care options.

                    An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord.
                    There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS).   The tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer):         - Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back).     - Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue.         When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment.   Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for more information on the treatment of children.)   For information about lymphoma that begins in the brain, see the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment.
                
                
                    A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor.
                    Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.   Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.    Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer. Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include:         -  Melanoma.    -  Breast cancer.    -  Colon cancer.    -  Kidney cancer.    -  Nasopharyngeal cancer.    -  Cancer of unknown primary site.        Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include:         -  Breast cancer.    - Lung cancer.    -  Leukemia.    -  Lymphoma.        See the following for more information from PDQ about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord:         -  Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Breast Cancer Treatment     -  Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment     -  Colon Cancer Treatment     -  Leukemia Home Page     -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment     -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment     -  Renal Cell Cancer Treatment     -  Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment
                
                
                    The brain controls many important body functions.
                    The brain has three major parts:          - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.     - The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture.     - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat.
                
                
                    The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body.
                    The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.
                
                
                    There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors.
                    Brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS. The grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow-growing and fast-growing types of the tumor. The World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.      WHO Tumor Grading System       - Grade I (low-grade)  The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery.    - Grade II  The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor.    - Grade III  The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue.    - Grade IV (high-grade)  The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured.        The following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord:     Astrocytic Tumors    An astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. Astrocytic tumors include the following:            -  Brain stem glioma (usually high grade): A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Treatment for more information.)     -  Pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle.      -  Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I): A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured.      -  Diffuse astrocytoma (grade II): A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma.      -  Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma.      -  Glioblastoma (grade IV): A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. It is also called glioblastoma multiforme.            See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about astrocytomas in children.       Oligodendroglial Tumors    An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following:            -  Oligodendroglioma (grade II): An oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured.      -  Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III): An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured.             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about oligodendroglial tumors in children.       Mixed Gliomas    A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it  oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma.            -  Oligoastrocytoma (grade II): An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured.     -  Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade II).             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about mixed gliomas in children.       Ependymal Tumors    An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid -filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following:            -  Ependymoma (grade I or II): A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. There are two types of grade I ependymoma  myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. In some cases, a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured.     -  Anaplastic ependymoma (grade III): An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma.             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Ependymoma Treatment for more information about ependymoma in children.       Medulloblastomas    A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults.      See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about medulloblastomas in children.       Pineal Parenchymal Tumors     A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following:            -  Pineocytoma (grade II): A pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor.     -  Pineoblastoma (grade IV): A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread.            See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in children.       Meningeal Tumors    A meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following:            -  Meningioma (grade I): A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the dura mater. A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery.     -  Meningioma (grade II and III): This is a rare meningeal tumor. It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.            A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.        Germ Cell Tumors    A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant.     See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain.       Craniopharyngioma (Grade I)    A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the pituitary gland (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells.     See the PDQ summary on Childhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment for more information about craniopharyngioma in children.","Genetic syndromes play a significant role in influencing the risk of developing adult central nervous system tumors. Certain genetic conditions can increase the likelihood of brain tumors, acting as risk factors that predispose individuals to this type of cancer. Here are examples of genetic syndromes associated with a higher risk of central nervous system tumors:

1. **Neurofibromatosis Type 1 (NF1)**: This condition is linked to various tumors, including gliomas.
2. **Neurofibromatosis Type 2 (NF2)**: Individuals with NF2 are at increased risk for acoustic neuromas and other tumors.
3. **Von Hippel-Lindau Disease**: This syndrome can lead to hemangioblastomas in the central nervous system.
4. **Tuberous Sclerosis**: This genetic disorder is associated with benign tumors in various organs, including the brain.
5. **Li-Fraumeni Syndrome**: This hereditary condition increases the risk for several types of cancers, including brain tumors.
6. **Turcot Syndrome (type 1 and type 2)**: This syndrome can lead to the development of brain tumors along with colorectal cancers.
7. **Nevoid Basal Cell Carcinoma Syndrome**: Associated with medulloblastomas and other central nervous system tumors.

                    Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that forms in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors. There are three types of lymphocytes:               -  B lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.      -  T lymphocytes that help B lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.      -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.             -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.    -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.     -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can begin in B lymphocytes, T lymphocytes, or natural killer cells. Lymphocytes can also be found in the blood and collect in the lymph nodes, spleen, and thymus.   Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.   Non-Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for children is different than treatment for adults. See the following PDQ summaries for information about treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma in adults:         -  Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma     -  Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment     -  Mycosis Fungoides and the Sezary Syndrome Treatment
                
                
                    The main types of lymphoma are Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. See the PDQ summary on Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for information about childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
                
                
                    There are three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    The type of lymphoma is determined by how the cells look under a microscope. The three major types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are:     Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma    Mature B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas include:            -  Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia: Burkitt lymphoma and Burkitt leukemia are different forms of the same disease. Burkitt lymphoma/leukemia is an aggressive (fast-growing) disorder of B lymphocytes that is most common in children and young adults. It may form in the abdomen, Waldeyer's ring, testicles, bone, bone marrow, skin, or central nervous system (CNS). Burkitt leukemia may start in the lymph nodes as Burkitt lymphoma and then spread to the blood and bone marrow, or it may start in the blood and bone marrow without forming in the lymph nodes first. Both Burkitt leukemia and Burkitt lymphoma have been linked to infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), although EBV infection is more likely to occur in patients in Africa than in the United States. Burkitt and Burkitt-like lymphoma/leukemia are diagnosed when a sample of tissue is checked and a certain change to the c-myc gene is found.     -   Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma: Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma is the most common type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. It is a type of B-cell non-Hodgkin lymphoma that grows quickly in the lymph nodes. The spleen, liver, bone marrow, or other organs are also often affected. Diffuse large B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in adolescents than in children.     -   Primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma: A type of lymphoma that develops from B cells in the mediastinum (the area behind the breastbone). It may spread to nearby organs including the lungs and the sac around the heart. It may also spread to lymph nodes and distant organs including the kidneys. In children and adolescents, primary mediastinal B-cell lymphoma occurs more often in older adolescents.              Lymphoblastic lymphoma     Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes. It usually forms in the mediastinum (the area behind the breastbone). This causes trouble breathing, wheezing, trouble swallowing, or swelling of the head and neck. It may spread to lymph nodes, bone, bone marrow, skin, the CNS, abdominal organs, and other areas. Lymphoblastic lymphoma is a lot like acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL).       Anaplastic large cell lymphoma     Anaplastic large cell lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that mainly affects T-cell lymphocytes. It usually forms in the lymph nodes, skin, or bone, and sometimes forms in the gastrointestinal tract, lung, tissue that covers the lungs, and muscle. Patients with anaplastic large cell lymphoma have a receptor, called CD30, on the surface of their T cells. In many children, anaplastic large cell lymphoma is marked by changes in the  ALK  gene that makes a protein called anaplastic lymphoma kinase. A pathologist checks for these cell and gene changes to help diagnose anaplastic large cell lymphoma.
                
                
                    Some types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma are rare in children.
                    Some types of childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma are less common. These include:         -  Pediatric-type follicular lymphoma : In children, follicular lymphoma occurs mainly in males. It is more likely to be found in one area and does not spread to other places in the body. It usually forms in the tonsils and lymph nodes in the neck, but may also form in the testicles, kidney, gastrointestinal tract, and salivary gland.    -   Marginal zone lymphoma : Marginal zone lymphoma is a type of lymphoma that tends to grow and spread slowly and is usually found at an early stage. It may be found in the lymph nodes or in areas outside the lymph nodes. Marginal zone lymphoma found outside the lymph nodes in children is called mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma and may be linked to  Helicobacter pylori  infection of the gastrointestinal tract and  Chlamydophila psittaci  infection of the conjunctival membrane which lines the eye.    -   Primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma : Primary CNS lymphoma is extremely rare in children.    -   Peripheral T-cell lymphoma : Peripheral T-cell lymphoma is an aggressive (fast-growing) non-Hodgkin lymphoma that begins in mature T lymphocytes. The T lymphocytes mature in the thymus gland and travel to other parts of the lymph system, such as the lymph nodes, bone marrow, and spleen.    -   Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma : Cutaneous T-cell lymphoma begins in the skin and can cause the skin to thicken or form a tumor. It is very rare in children, but is more common in adolescents and young adults. There are different types of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma, such as cutaneous anaplastic large cell lymphoma, subcutaneous panniculitis-like T-cell lymphoma, gamma-delta T-cell lymphoma, and mycosis fungoides. Mycosis fungoides rarely occurs in children and adolescents.
                
                
                    Past treatment for cancer and having a weakened immune system affect the risk of having childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    Possible risk factors for childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include the following:         - Past treatment for cancer.    - Being infected with the Epstein-Barr virus or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).    - Having a weakened immune system after a transplant or from medicines given after a transplant.    - Having certain inherited diseases of the immune system.        If lymphoma or lymphoproliferative disease is linked to a weakened immune system from certain inherited diseases, HIV infection, a transplant or medicines given after a transplant, the condition is called lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency. The different types of lymphoproliferative disease associated with immunodeficiency include:         - Lymphoproliferative disease associated with primary immunodeficiency.    - HIV-associated non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    -  Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease.","Diagnostic procedures commonly utilized to detect childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma include:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: Examination to check for general health signs, lumps, or anything unusual, along with taking a medical history.

2. **Blood Tests**: This includes blood chemistry studies and complete blood count (CBC) to measure various parameters and detect signs of disease.

3. **Imaging Tests**: 
   - **CT Scan**: Produces detailed pictures of internal areas.
   - **PET Scan**: Identifies malignant tumor cells based on glucose uptake.
   - **Chest X-ray**: Assesses the organs and bones in the chest.
   - **Ultrasound Exam**: Uses sound waves to create images of internal organs.

4. **Lumbar Puncture**: Collects cerebrospinal fluid to check for cancer spread to the CNS.

5. **Biopsy**: A key diagnostic procedure for confirming childhood non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A biopsy involves removing cells and tissues that are then viewed under a microscope to check for cancer signs. Biopsy types include:
   - **Excisional Biopsy**: Removing an entire lymph node or lump.
   - **Incisional Biopsy**: Removing part of a lump or lymph node.
   - **Core Biopsy**: Using a wide needle to remove tissue.
   - **Fine-Needle Aspiration (FNA) Biopsy**: Using a thin needle to remove tissue.

                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. There is no standard staging system for pituitary tumors. Once a pituitary tumor is found, tests are done to find out if the tumor has spread into the brain or to other parts of the body. The following test may be used:          -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
                
                
                    Pituitary tumors are described in several ways.
                    Pituitary tumors are described by their size and grade, whether or not they make extra hormones, and whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.   The following sizes are used:         - Microadenoma: The tumor is smaller than 1 centimeter.    - Macroadenoma: The tumor is 1 centimeter or larger.        Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas.    The grade of a pituitary tumor is based on how far it has grown into the surrounding area of the brain, including the sella (the bone at the base of the skull, where the pituitary gland sits).","MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of pituitary tumors. It is a procedure that utilizes a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create a series of detailed images of areas inside the body, particularly the brain and spinal cord. During an MRI for pituitary tumors, a contrast agent called gadolinium may be injected into a vein, which helps highlight the tumor by making it appear brighter in the images. This imaging technique is also referred to as nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). MRI helps visualize the extent of the tumor, assess any potential spread into surrounding brain areas, and inform treatment decisions.",198,What role does MRI play in the diagnosis of pituitary tumors and what does this imaging technique entail?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the role of MRI in diagnosing pituitary tumors, which is a key component of the original answer.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.    NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider. For more information on breast cancer risk, call 1-800-4-CANCER.
                
                
                    The following are risk factors for breast cancer:
                    Older age    Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.        A personal history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease    Women with any of the following have an increased risk of breast cancer:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.              Inherited risk of breast cancer    Women with a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) have an increased risk of breast cancer.    Women who have inherited changes in the  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  genes or in certain other genes have a higher risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer caused by inherited gene changes depends on the type of gene mutation, family history of cancer, and other factors.        Dense breasts    Having breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram is a factor in breast cancer risk. The level of risk depends on how dense the breast tissue is. Women with very dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with low breast density.    Increased breast density is often an inherited trait, but it may also occur in women who have not had children, have a first pregnancy late in life, take postmenopausal hormones, or drink alcohol.       Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body     Estrogen is a hormone made by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Being exposed to estrogen over a long time may increase the risk of breast cancer. Estrogen levels are highest during the years a woman is menstruating.     A woman's exposure to estrogen is increased in the following ways:            -  Early menstruation: Beginning to have menstrual periods at age 11 or younger increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  Starting menopause at a later age: The more years a woman menstruates, the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, breast tissue is exposed to more estrogen in women who become pregnant for the first time after age 35 or who never become pregnant.              Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause     Hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, can be made into a pill form in a laboratory. Estrogen, progestin, or both may be given to replace the estrogen no longer made by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women who have had their ovaries removed. This is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or hormone therapy (HT). Combination HRT/HT is estrogen combined with progestin. This type of HRT/HT increases the risk of breast cancer. Studies show that when women stop taking estrogen combined with progestin, the risk of breast cancer decreases.       Radiation therapy to the breast or chest     Radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, starting 10 years after treatment. The risk of breast cancer depends on the dose of radiation and the age at which it is given. The risk is highest if radiation treatment was used during puberty, when breasts are forming.     Radiation therapy to treat cancer in one breast does not appear to increase the risk of cancer in the other breast.    For women who have inherited changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, exposure to radiation, such as that from chest x-rays, may further increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in women who were x-rayed before 20 years of age.       Obesity     Obesity increases the risk of breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy.       Drinking alcohol     Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. The level of risk rises as the amount of alcohol consumed rises.
                
                
                    The following are protective factors for breast cancer:
                    Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body    Decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help prevent breast cancer. Exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways:            -   Early pregnancy: Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy. Women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35.     -  Breast-feeding: Estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breast-feeding. Women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed.              Taking estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators       Estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy     Hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy. In these women, estrogen-only therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer. There is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy.          Selective estrogen receptor modulators      Tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs act like estrogen on some tissues in the body, but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues.     Treatment with tamoxifen lowers the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at high risk. Treatment with raloxifene also lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. With either drug, the reduced risk lasts for several years or longer after treatment is stopped. Lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene.      Taking tamoxifen increases the risk of hot flashes, endometrial cancer, stroke, cataracts, and blood clots (especially in the lungs and legs). The risk of having these problems increases markedly in women older than 50 years compared with younger women. Women younger than 50 years who have a high risk of breast cancer may benefit the most from taking tamoxifen. The risk of having these problems decreases after tamoxifen is stopped. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.      Taking raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots in the lungs and legs, but does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (decreased bone density), raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer for women who have a high or low risk of breast cancer. It is not known if raloxifene would have the same effect in women who do not have osteoporosis. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.     Other SERMs are being studied in clinical trials.          Aromatase inhibitors and inactivators      Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) and inactivators (exemestane) lower the risk of recurrence and of new breast cancers in women who have a history of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women with the following conditions:                -  Postmenopausal women with a personal history of breast cancer.      -  Women with no personal history of breast cancer who are 60 years and older, have a history of ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy, or have a high risk of breast cancer based on the Gail model tool (a tool used to estimate the risk of breast cancer).               In women with an increased risk of breast cancer, taking aromatase inhibitors decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body. Before menopause, estrogen is made by the ovaries and other tissues in a woman's body, including the brain, fat tissue, and skin. After menopause, the ovaries stop making estrogen, but the other tissues do not. Aromatase inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called aromatase, which is used to make all of the body's estrogen. Aromatase inactivators stop the enzyme from working.     Possible harms from taking aromatase inhibitors include muscle and joint pain, osteoporosis, hot flashes, and feeling very tired.           Risk-reducing mastectomy     Some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing mastectomy (the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer). The risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer. However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision.       Ovarian ablation    The ovaries make most of the estrogen that is made by the body. Treatments that stop or lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries include surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs. This is called ovarian ablation.    Premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may choose to have a risk-reducing oophorectomy (the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer). This decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer. Risk-reducing oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest. However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision. The sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin. These include hot flashes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and depression. Long-term effects include decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, and decreased bone density.        Getting enough exercise    Women who exercise four or more hours a week have a lower risk of breast cancer. The effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in premenopausal women who have normal or low body weight.
                
                
                    It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer:
                    Oral contraceptives    Certain oral contraceptives contain estrogen. Some studies have shown that taking oral contraceptives (""the pill"") may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users. This risk decreases over time. Other studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who take oral contraceptives.     Progestin -only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. More studies are needed to know whether progestin-only oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer.       Environment    Studies have not proven that being exposed to certain substances in the environment, such as chemicals, increases the risk of breast cancer.
                
                
                    Studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer.
                    The following do not affect the risk of breast cancer:            - Having an abortion.     - Making diet changes such as eating less fat or more fruits and vegetables.     - Taking vitamins, including fenretinide (a type of vitamin A).     -  Cigarette smoking, both active and passive (inhaling secondhand smoke).     -  Using underarm deodorant or antiperspirant.     - Taking statins (cholesterol -lowering drugs).     - Taking bisphosphonates (drugs used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia) by mouth or by intravenous infusion.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.   The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent breast cancer are being studied in clinical trials.","Hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause can contribute to breast cancer risk primarily through the exposure of breast tissue to estrogen. Estrogen promotes the growth and development of breast tissue, and extended exposure to this hormone has been associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Specifically, the combination of estrogen and progestin in HRT has been shown to elevate the risk of breast cancer. Studies indicate that when women stop taking this combined therapy, the risk of breast cancer tends to decrease.

To mitigate these risks, several alternatives can be considered:
1. **Estrogen-only hormone therapy after a hysterectomy**: For women who have undergone a hysterectomy, taking estrogen alone may not have the same risk-enhancing effects as combined HRT.
2. **Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)**: Drugs like tamoxifen and raloxifene can help lower the risk of breast cancer by blocking estrogen effects on breast tissue in high-risk women.
3. **Aromatase inhibitors**: These medications reduce the amount of estrogen produced in the body, which can be beneficial for women with a history of breast cancer or those at high risk.
4. **Lifestyle changes**: Increasing physical activity, maintaining a healthy weight, and participating in regular breast screenings are protective factors that can also lower breast cancer risk.

It is essential for women considering HRT or worried about breast cancer risks to discuss their individual situations with their healthcare providers to select the most appropriate approach for managing menopausal symptoms while minimizing cancer risks.",519,Can you explain how hormone replacement therapy during menopause contributes to breast cancer risk and what alternatives could be considered?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of how hormone replacement therapy (HRT) during menopause is linked to breast cancer risk, aligning closely with the information in the original answer regarding hormone therapy's impact.

This demonstrates an accurate understanding and integration of key points related to breast cancer risk factors and prevention."
"Key Points
                    - Screening tests have risks.    - The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:         -  Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     - False-negative test results can occur.     - False-positive test results can occur.
                
                
                    Screening tests have risks.
                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
                
                
                    The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:
                    Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     When a screening test result leads to the diagnosis and treatment of a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening, it is called overdiagnosis. For example, when a urine test result shows a higher than normal amount of homovanillic acid (HMA) or vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA), tests and treatments for neuroblastoma are likely to be done, but may not be needed. At this time, it is not possible to know which neuroblastomas found by a screening test will cause symptoms and which neuroblastomas will not. Diagnostic tests (such as biopsies) and cancer treatments (such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) can have serious risks, including physical and emotional problems.       False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though neuroblastoma is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests and procedures, which also have risks.","A false-positive test result can significantly impact a patient's mental health and the course of further medical testing. When a test indicates the presence of cancer that is not actually there, it can lead to increased anxiety, fear, and stress for the patient as they navigate the implications of a potential cancer diagnosis. This heightened emotional state may result in the patient undergoing unnecessary additional tests and procedures, such as biopsies or surgeries, which can carry their own risks, including infection and complications.

Moreover, the psychological burden of receiving a false-positive result can cause patients to experience prolonged uncertainty and distress, which can affect their overall mental well-being. The situation can also lead to a lack of trust in future testing and healthcare providers, complicating the patient's relationship with the medical system and their willingness to seek care when needed. Ultimately, a false-positive result can create a cascade of negative emotional and logistical consequences, all of which underscore the importance of clear communication and support from healthcare providers during the diagnostic process.",179,How might a false-positive test result impact a patient's mental health and the course of further medical testing?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of false-positive test results on mental health and further medical testing, which is a key point discussed in the original answer.

                    Tests done to detect thymoma or thymic carcinoma are also used to stage the disease.
                    Staging is the process used to find out if cancer has spread from the thymus to other parts of the body. The findings made during surgery and the results of tests and procedures are used to determine the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if thymic carcinoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually thymic carcinoma cells. The disease is metastatic thymic carcinoma, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for thymoma:
                    Stage I    In stage I, cancer is found only within the thymus. All cancer cells are inside the capsule (sac) that surrounds the thymus.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread through the capsule and into the fat around the thymus or into the lining of the chest cavity.       Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread to nearby organs in the chest, including the lung, the sac around the heart, or large blood vessels that carry blood to the heart.       Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB, depending on where the cancer has spread.            - In stage IVA, cancer has spread widely around the lungs and heart.     - In stage IVB, cancer has spread to the blood or lymph system.
                
                
                    Thymic carcinomas have usually spread to other parts of the body when diagnosed.
                    The staging system used for thymomas is sometimes used for thymic carcinomas.","The stages of thymoma are defined as follows, based on the extent of cancer spread:

- **Stage I**: Cancer is confined to the thymus and all cancer cells are inside the capsule that surrounds the thymus.
  
- **Stage II**: Cancer has spread through the capsule and into the fat surrounding the thymus or into the lining of the chest cavity.

- **Stage III**: Cancer has spread to nearby organs in the chest, which may include the lung, the sac around the heart, or large blood vessels that carry blood to the heart.

- **Stage IV**: This stage is further divided into two sub-stages:
  - **Stage IVA**: Cancer has spread widely around the lungs and heart.
  - **Stage IVB**: Cancer has spread to the blood or lymph system.

Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy and tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are types of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.      Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that is being studied in the treatment of Kaposi sarcoma.    TKIs are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with Merkel cell carcinoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery    One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma:            -  Wide local excision: The cancer is cut from the skin along with some of the tissue around it. A sentinel lymph node biopsy may be done during the wide local excision procedure. If there is cancer in the lymph nodes, a lymph node dissection also may be done.     - Lymph node dissection: A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymph node dissection, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed; for a radical lymph node dissection, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.           Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat Merkel cell carcinoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.

                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

"Key Points
                    - Screening tests have risks.    - The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:         -  Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     - False-negative test results can occur.     - False-positive test results can occur.
                
                
                    Screening tests have risks.
                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to discuss the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
                
                
                    The risks of neuroblastoma screening include the following:
                    Neuroblastoma may be overdiagnosed.     When a screening test result leads to the diagnosis and treatment of a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening, it is called overdiagnosis. For example, when a urine test result shows a higher than normal amount of homovanillic acid (HMA) or vanillyl mandelic acid (VMA), tests and treatments for neuroblastoma are likely to be done, but may not be needed. At this time, it is not possible to know which neuroblastomas found by a screening test will cause symptoms and which neuroblastomas will not. Diagnostic tests (such as biopsies) and cancer treatments (such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy) can have serious risks, including physical and emotional problems.       False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though neuroblastoma is present. A person who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if there are symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests and procedures, which also have risks.","It is important to discuss screening tests with a doctor before proceeding, especially concerning neuroblastoma, because screening tests have associated risks. These risks include the possibility of overdiagnosis, where a screening result leads to diagnosing and treating a disease that may never have caused symptoms or become life-threatening. For instance, a urine test might show elevated levels of certain substances, which could prompt unnecessary tests and treatments for neuroblastoma that might not be needed. Additionally, screening tests can yield false-negative results, which can lead to a delay in seeking medical care even if symptoms are present, or false-positive results, causing anxiety and leading to more tests, which also have risks. Therefore, understanding these risks and the implications of the tests is crucial before proceeding with neuroblastoma screening.",179,"Why is it important to discuss screening tests with a doctor before proceeding, especially concerning neuroblastoma?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of discussing screening tests with a doctor, particularly in the context of neuroblastoma.

"Smoking is the major risk factor for small cell lung cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for lung cancer.    Risk factors for lung cancer include the following:            -  Smoking cigarettes, pipes, or cigars, now or in the past. This is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. The earlier in life a person starts smoking, the more often a person smokes, and the more years a person smokes, the greater the risk of lung cancer.      -  Being exposed to secondhand smoke.     - Being exposed to radiation from any of the following:                  -  Radiation therapy to the breast or chest.       -  Radon in the home or workplace.       -  Imaging tests such as CT scans.       - Atomic bomb radiation.                 -  Being exposed to asbestos, chromium, nickel, beryllium, arsenic, soot, or tar in the workplace.     -  Living where there is air pollution.     -  Having a family history of lung cancer.     -  Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).     -  Taking beta carotene supplements and being a heavy smoker.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.     When smoking is combined with other risk factors, the risk of lung cancer is increased.","Living in an area with high levels of air pollution correlates with the risk factors for lung cancer in the following ways:

1. **Environmental Risk Factor**: Air pollution is listed as an environmental risk factor for lung cancer. Studies indicate that higher levels of air pollution increase the risk of developing lung cancer.

2. **Combined Effects with Smoking**: The risk of lung cancer is heightened for individuals who smoke and also live in polluted environments. Smoking is the most significant risk factor for lung cancer, and exposure to air pollution compounds this risk.

3. **Other Related Environmental Factors**: Along with air pollution, factors such as radon exposure and workplace exposures to carcinogens also contribute to lung cancer risk, suggesting that a variety of environmental conditions can influence lung cancer development.

Overall, individuals residing in areas with high air pollution face an increased risk of lung cancer, which can be exacerbated by other factors such as smoking and exposure to other environmental carcinogens.",37,In what ways does living in an area with high levels of air pollution correlate with the risk factors for lung cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the correlation between living in an area with high air pollution and the risk factors for lung cancer, aligning closely with the original answer's emphasis on air pollution as a risk factor.

Health history and certain medicines can affect the risk of developing endometrial cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor. Risk factors for endometrial cancer include the following:         - Taking tamoxifen for treatment or prevention of breast cancer.    - Taking estrogen alone. (Taking estrogen in combination with progestin does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer.)    - Being overweight.    - Eating a high-fat diet.    -  Never giving birth.    - Beginning menstruation at an early age.    - Reaching menopause at an older age.    - Having the gene for hereditary non-polyposis colon cancer (HNPCC).     - Being white.,"Reproductive history and age at specific life stages significantly impact the risk factors associated with endometrial cancer. Key points include:

1. **Age of Menstruation**: Starting menstruation at an early age increases a woman's cumulative exposure to estrogen over the years, thereby elevating her risk of developing endometrial cancer.

2. **Menopause**: Women who experience menopause at an older age have longer exposures to estrogen, which also heightens the risk of endometrial cancer.

3. **Pregnancy**: Women who have never been pregnant are exposed to estrogen for more extended periods compared to those who have been pregnant. As estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, the absence of pregnancy correlates with an increased risk of endometrial cancer.

These factors indicate that reproductive history, including age at menarche and menopause, as well as pregnancy history, plays a crucial role in modulating estrogen exposure and consequently influencing the risk of developing endometrial cancer.",65,How do reproductive history and age at specific life stages impact the risk factors associated with endometrial cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses the impact of reproductive history and age on the risk factors associated with endometrial cancer, aligning closely with the original answer's mention of factors like age of menstruation, menopause, and pregnancy history.

"Key Points
                    - Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.    - Older age and being male increase the risk of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia.    - Signs and symptoms of chronic myelomonocytic leukemia include fever, weight loss, and feeling very tired.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Chronic myelomonocytic leukemia is a disease in which too many myelocytes and monocytes (immature white blood cells) are made in the bone marrow.
                    In chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML), the body tells too many blood stem cells to become two types of white blood cells called myelocytes and monocytes. Some of these blood stem cells never become mature white blood cells. These immature white blood cells are called blasts. Over time, the myelocytes, monocytes, and blasts crowd out the red blood cells and platelets in the bone marrow. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur.","The specific age group at higher risk for developing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) is older adults, and the gender at higher risk is male. This information is relevant for screening because identifying these risk factors can help target screening efforts towards populations that are more likely to develop the disease, allowing for earlier detection and treatment options.",421,"What specific age group and gender are at a higher risk for developing chronic myelomonocytic leukemia, and why might that be relevant for screening?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear and accurate summary of the age and gender risk factors associated with chronic myelomonocytic leukemia (CMML) as mentioned in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer in men.
                    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Clinical breast exam (CBE): An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.     -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -    MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The following are different types of biopsies:                -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle.       -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.      -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.
                
                
                    If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.
                    Decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests. The tests give information about:         - How quickly the cancer may grow.    - How likely it is that the cancer will spread through the body.    - How well certain treatments might work.    - How likely the cancer is to recur (come back).        Tests include the following:         -   Estrogen and progesterone receptor test : A test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If cancer is found in the breast, tissue from the tumor is checked in the laboratory to find out whether estrogen and progesterone could affect the way cancer grows. The test results show whether hormone therapy may stop the cancer from growing.    -   HER2 test: A test to measure the amount of HER2 in cancer tissue. HER2 is a growth factor protein that sends growth signals to cells. When cancer forms, the cells may make too much of the protein, causing more cancer cells to grow. If cancer is found in the breast, tissue from the tumor is checked in the laboratory to find out if there is too much HER2 in the cells. The test results show whether monoclonal antibody therapy may stop the cancer from growing.","To initially diagnose male breast cancer, the following specific tests are conducted:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: A comprehensive assessment of the body, checking for general signs of health, including the presence of lumps or any unusual signs.

  - **Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy:** Involves the removal of tissue or fluid using a thin needle. This method is less invasive and is typically used to sample suspicious areas without removing a large section of tissue.
  - **Excisional biopsy:** Involves the removal of the entire lump or area of tissue that appears abnormal. This procedure is more invasive and provides a larger sample for analysis.

- **Outcomes:**
  - An FNA biopsy is useful for obtaining a rapid diagnosis and can give preliminary insights, but it may not provide a sufficient amount of tissue for a definitive diagnosis of the cancer type or grade.
  - An excisional biopsy offers a comprehensive sample, which can result in a more accurate diagnosis and allow for detailed evaluation of the cancer's characteristics, leading to better-informed treatment decisions.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -   Urine catecholamine studies: A procedure in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amount of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher than normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   X-ray : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan : A procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive mIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive mIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the mIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. mIBG is used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes.

                    Polycythemia vera is a disease in which too many red blood cells are made in the bone marrow.
                    In polycythemia vera, the blood becomes thickened with too many red blood cells. The number of white blood cells and platelets may also increase. These extra blood cells may collect in the spleen and cause it to swell. The increased number of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets in the blood can cause bleeding problems and make clots form in blood vessels. This can increase the risk of stroke or heart attack. In patients who are older than 65 years or who have a history of blood clots, the risk of stroke or heart attack is higher. Patients also have an increased risk of acute myeloid leukemia or primary myelofibrosis.","The overproduction of red blood cells in polycythemia vera leads to complications such as stroke or heart attack primarily because it thickens the blood. This increased thickness can cause the blood to flow less smoothly, increasing the likelihood of blood clots forming in blood vessels. The presence of extra red blood cells, along with elevated white blood cells and platelets, can further exacerbate this risk. As a consequence, these clots can obstruct blood flow to critical areas, potentially resulting in a stroke or heart attack. Additionally, the risk is elevated in patients over the age of 65 or those with a history of blood clots.",701,How does the overproduction of red blood cells in polycythemia vera contribute to complications such as stroke or heart attack?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question about how the overproduction of red blood cells in polycythemia vera contributes to complications such as stroke or heart attack.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with uterine sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with uterine sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is the most common treatment for uterine sarcoma, as described in the Stages of Uterine Sarcoma section of this summary.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat uterine sarcoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances produced by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back).

1. **External Radiation Therapy**: This type of radiation therapy utilizes a machine located outside the body to direct high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation toward the cancer. This method is aimed at the tumor from outside the body to kill cancer cells or inhibit their growth. It is often used in the pelvis for treating uterine sarcoma after surgery or as part of the treatment regimen.

2. **Internal Radiation Therapy**: Also known as brachytherapy, this approach involves placing a radioactive substance directly into or near the tumor. The radioactive materials are typically sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters, allowing for high doses of radiation to be delivered to the cancer while minimizing exposure to surrounding healthy tissue.

Both external and internal radiation therapy can be utilized to treat uterine sarcoma effectively, and they may also be employed as palliative care to alleviate symptoms and improve the quality of life for patients. The choice of which method to use depends on various factors, including the type and stage of cancer and the overall treatment strategy.",14,Can you explain the differences between external and internal radiation therapy as they pertain to treating uterine sarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the differences between external and internal radiation therapy as used to treat uterine sarcoma, closely aligning with the information provided in the original answer.

Male breast cancer is sometimes caused by inherited gene mutations (changes).The genes in cells carry the hereditary information that is received from a persons parents. Hereditary breast cancer makes up about 5% to 10% of all breast cancer. Some mutated genes related to breast cancer are more common in certain ethnic groups. Men who have a mutated gene related to breast cancer have an increased risk of this disease.    There are tests that can detect (find) mutated genes. These genetic tests are sometimes done for members of families with a high risk of cancer. See the following PDQ summaries for more information:         -  Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers     -  Breast Cancer Prevention     -  Breast Cancer Screening,"Specific gene mutations known to contribute to an increased risk of male breast cancer include BRCA2 mutations, which are associated with hereditary breast cancer.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
				                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of adult AML.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.
				                
				                
				                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
				                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

				                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

                    Transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the renal pelvis and ureter.
                    The renal pelvis is the top part of the ureter. The ureter is a long tube that connects the kidney to the bladder. There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. The kidneys of an adult are about 5 inches long and 3 inches wide and are shaped like a kidney bean. Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. They take out waste products and make urine. The urine collects in the middle of each kidney in the renal pelvis. Urine passes from the renal pelvis through the ureter into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the urethra and leaves the body.      The renal pelvis and ureters are lined with transitional cells. These cells can change shape and stretch without breaking apart. Transitional cell cancer starts in these cells. Transitional cell cancer can form in the renal pelvis or the ureter or both.    Renal cell cancer is a more common type of kidney cancer. See the PDQ summary about Renal Cell Cancer Treatment for more information.","A patient should be aware of the following specific symptoms that may indicate the presence of transitional cell cancer in the renal pelvis or ureter:

1. Blood in the urine
2. Back pain that does not go away
3. Extreme tiredness
4. Unexplained weight loss
5. Painful or frequent urination

It is important to check with a doctor if any of these symptoms occur, as they may also be caused by other conditions. Early stages of the cancer may not present any symptoms.",451,What specific symptoms should a patient be aware of that may indicate the presence of transitional cell cancer in the renal pelvis or ureter?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively lists specific symptoms of transitional cell cancer of the renal pelvis and ureter, aligning well with the original answer's mention of blood in the urine and back pain.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas. The following specialists may also be included:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric hematologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Child-life specialist.
                
                
                    Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:          - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Eight types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible. If the tumor is very large, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. This is called neoadjuvant therapy.    The following types of surgery may be used:            -  Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it.      -  Amputation: Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer, such as the arm or hand.     -  Lymphadenectomy: Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer.      -  Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin. Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed. This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery.     -  Hepatectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the liver.           A second surgery may be needed to:            - Remove any remaining cancer cells.     - Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed.           If cancer is in the liver, a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done (the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor).    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated.     Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy.    See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be done when:             - Complete removal of the tumor is not possible.     - No other treatments are available.     - The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs.              Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Antiestrogens (drugs that block estrogen), such as tamoxifen, may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis.       Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) that are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. In the treatment of desmoid-type fibromatosis, an NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do.     Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase (a type of protein). There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions.             -  ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading:                  -  Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.                -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow:                   -  Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.       -  Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma. It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma.       - Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis.                      New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as LOXO-101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma.    Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials, including the following:            -  mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive. mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy.      -  Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as cediranib, sunitinib, and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors.     -  Histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow. HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma.      -  Heat-shock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow. Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.     -  Antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma.           See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease.     Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth.
                         
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    After renal cell cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if renal cell cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually cancerous renal cells. The disease is metastatic renal cell cancer, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for renal cell cancer:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found only in the kidney.       Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is larger than 7 centimeters and is found only in the kidney.        Stage III    In stage III:            - the tumor is any size and cancer is found only in the kidney and in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes; or      - cancer is found in the main blood vessels of the kidney or in the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney. Cancer may be found in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - beyond the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney and may be found in the adrenal gland above the kidney with cancer, or in nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other organs, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain, and may have spread to lymph nodes.","Renal cell cancer metastasizes primarily through three pathways: **tissue**, **lymphatic system**, and **blood**. 

1. **Tissue**: Cancer can spread by growing into nearby areas from the original tumor site.

2. **Lymphatic System**: Cancer cells can enter the lymphatic system and travel through lymph vessels to reach other parts of the body, potentially forming metastatic tumors in those locations.

3. **Blood**: Alternatively, cancer cells may invade blood vessels and circulate through the bloodstream, allowing them to spread to distant organs and form new tumors.

When renal cell cancer spreads to other parts of the body, it is termed metastasis. For example, if renal cell cancer spreads to the bones, the new tumors consist of renal cell cancer cells, not bone cancer cells.",386,How does renal cell cancer metastasize and what are the possible pathways for its spread to other parts of the body?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses how renal cell cancer metastasizes by detailing the three pathways (tissue, lymphatic system, and blood) and explaining the concept of metastasis clearly.

                    - Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.    - Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer.     - Signs and symptoms of gallbladder cancer include jaundice, fever, and pain.     - Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.     - Tests that examine the gallbladder and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage gallbladder cancer.     - Certain factors affect the prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Gallbladder cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the gallbladder.
                    Gallbladder cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells are found in the tissues of the gallbladder. The gallbladder is a pear-shaped organ that lies just under the liver in the upper abdomen. The gallbladder stores bile, a fluid made by the liver to digest fat. When food is being broken down in the stomach and intestines, bile is released from the gallbladder through a tube called the common bile duct, which connects the gallbladder and liver to the first part of the small intestine.      The wall of the gallbladder has 3 main layers of tissue.          -  Mucosal (inner) layer.    - Muscularis (middle, muscle) layer.     -  Serosal (outer) layer.        Between these layers is supporting connective tissue. Primary gallbladder cancer starts in the inner layer and spreads through the outer layers as it grows.
                
                
                    Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.
                    Gallbladder cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:         - There are no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer.    - The symptoms of gallbladder cancer, when present, are like the symptoms of many other illnesses.    - The gallbladder is hidden behind the liver.         Gallbladder cancer is sometimes found when the gallbladder is removed for other reasons. Patients with gallstones rarely develop gallbladder cancer.","Healthcare professionals face several challenges in the early detection and diagnosis of gallbladder cancer, including:

1. **Lack of Early Symptoms**: There are often no signs or symptoms in the early stages of gallbladder cancer, making it difficult for healthcare providers to identify the disease until it has progressed.

2. **Symptoms Similar to Other Illnesses**: When symptoms, such as jaundice, fever, and pain, do appear, they can be similar to those of many other conditions, leading to potential misdiagnosis.

3. **Anatomical Location**: The gallbladder is located behind the liver, which obscures visibility and access, complicating diagnostic efforts.

These factors contribute to the difficulty in detecting and diagnosing gallbladder cancer at an early stage.",247,What challenges do healthcare professionals face in the early detection and diagnosis of gallbladder cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the challenges healthcare professionals face in the early detection and diagnosis of gallbladder cancer, which directly correlates with the information provided in the original answer.

                    A pituitary tumor is a growth of abnormal cells in the tissues of the pituitary gland.
                    Pituitary tumors form in the pituitary gland, a pea-sized organ in the center of the brain, just above the back of the nose. The pituitary gland is sometimes called the ""master endocrine gland"" because it makes hormones that affect the way many parts of the body work. It also controls hormones made by many other glands in the body.      Pituitary tumors are divided into three groups:         -  Benign pituitary adenomas: Tumors that are not cancer. These tumors grow very slowly and do not spread from the pituitary gland to other parts of the body.     - Invasive pituitary adenomas: Benign tumors that may spread to bones of the skull or the sinus cavity below the pituitary gland.    - Pituitary carcinomas: Tumors that are malignant (cancer). These pituitary tumors spread into other areas of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or outside of the central nervous system. Very few pituitary tumors are malignant.        Pituitary tumors may be either non-functioning or functioning.          - Non-functioning pituitary tumors do not make extra amounts of hormones.    - Functioning pituitary tumors make more than the normal amount of one or more hormones. Most pituitary tumors are functioning tumors. The extra hormones made by pituitary tumors may cause certain signs or symptoms of disease.
                
                
                    The pituitary gland hormones control many other glands in the body.
                    Hormones made by the pituitary gland include:         -  Prolactin: A hormone that causes a womans breasts to make milk during and after pregnancy.     -  Adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH): A hormone that causes the adrenal glands to make a hormone called cortisol. Cortisol helps control the use of sugar, protein, and fats in the body and helps the body deal with stress.    -  Growth hormone: A hormone that helps control body growth and the use of sugar and fat in the body. Growth hormone is also called somatotropin.    -  Thyroid-stimulating hormone: A hormone that causes the thyroid gland to make other hormones that control growth, body temperature, and heart rate. Thyroid-stimulating hormone is also called thyrotropin.     -  Luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH): Hormones that control the menstrual cycle in women and the making of sperm in men.","The primary types of pituitary tumors are classified as follows:

1. **Benign Pituitary Adenomas**: These tumors are not cancerous, grow very slowly, and do not spread to other parts of the body. They typically remain localized within the pituitary gland.

2. **Invasive Pituitary Adenomas**: Although these tumors are also considered benign, they may spread into nearby structures such as the bones of the skull or the sinus cavity below the pituitary gland. They have a more aggressive behavior compared to non-invasive adenomas.

3. **Pituitary Carcinomas**: These are malignant tumors that can invade surrounding tissues and spread to other parts of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or even outside the central nervous system. This type is much less common compared to the benign forms.

In summary, benign pituitary adenomas and invasive adenomas generally do not spread beyond their surrounding environment, while pituitary carcinomas have the potential to metastasize to other regions, making them significantly more serious.",193,What are the primary types of pituitary tumors and how do they differ in terms of their behavior and potential to spread?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed classification of pituitary tumors as benign adenomas, invasive adenomas, and carcinomas, which aligns with the original answer's coverage of the topic. It includes information about their behavior and potential for spreading, mirroring the key points outlined in the original answer regarding tumor types and their characteristics. Thus, it is considered highly relevant."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the breast only or has spread to other parts of the body).    - The type of breast cancer.    - The age of the unborn baby.    - Whether there are signs or symptoms.    - The patients general health.,"A patient's overall health status significantly affects their treatment options and recovery chances for breast cancer. According to the context, key factors influencing prognosis and treatment options include:

- The patient's general health: A patient's overall health can determine how well they tolerate various treatments (such as surgery, chemotherapy, and radiation) and can influence treatment decisions.
- The stage of the cancer: This considers the size of the tumor and whether it has spread, which is essential in deciding treatment approaches.
- The type of breast cancer: Different types may respond differently to treatment, making the specific health status relevant.
- The age of the patient: Older age or specific health conditions may impact treatment choices and recovery outcomes.

Thus, a patient's overall health status is crucial for tailoring an appropriate treatment plan and predicting recovery chances.",662,How does a patient's overall health status affect their treatment options and recovery chances for breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about how a patient's overall health status affects treatment options and recovery chances for breast cancer.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.    NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider. For more information on breast cancer risk, call 1-800-4-CANCER.
                
                
                    The following are risk factors for breast cancer:
                    Older age    Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.        A personal history of breast cancer or benign (noncancer) breast disease    Women with any of the following have an increased risk of breast cancer:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.              Inherited risk of breast cancer    Women with a family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, sister, or daughter) have an increased risk of breast cancer.    Women who have inherited changes in the  BRCA1  and  BRCA2  genes or in certain other genes have a higher risk of breast cancer. The risk of breast cancer caused by inherited gene changes depends on the type of gene mutation, family history of cancer, and other factors.        Dense breasts    Having breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram is a factor in breast cancer risk. The level of risk depends on how dense the breast tissue is. Women with very dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer than women with low breast density.    Increased breast density is often an inherited trait, but it may also occur in women who have not had children, have a first pregnancy late in life, take postmenopausal hormones, or drink alcohol.       Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made in the body     Estrogen is a hormone made by the body. It helps the body develop and maintain female sex characteristics. Being exposed to estrogen over a long time may increase the risk of breast cancer. Estrogen levels are highest during the years a woman is menstruating.     A woman's exposure to estrogen is increased in the following ways:            -  Early menstruation: Beginning to have menstrual periods at age 11 or younger increases the number of years the breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  Starting menopause at a later age: The more years a woman menstruates, the longer her breast tissue is exposed to estrogen.     -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth: Because estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy, breast tissue is exposed to more estrogen in women who become pregnant for the first time after age 35 or who never become pregnant.              Taking hormone therapy for symptoms of menopause     Hormones, such as estrogen and progesterone, can be made into a pill form in a laboratory. Estrogen, progestin, or both may be given to replace the estrogen no longer made by the ovaries in postmenopausal women or women who have had their ovaries removed. This is called hormone replacement therapy (HRT) or hormone therapy (HT). Combination HRT/HT is estrogen combined with progestin. This type of HRT/HT increases the risk of breast cancer. Studies show that when women stop taking estrogen combined with progestin, the risk of breast cancer decreases.       Radiation therapy to the breast or chest     Radiation therapy to the chest for the treatment of cancer increases the risk of breast cancer, starting 10 years after treatment. The risk of breast cancer depends on the dose of radiation and the age at which it is given. The risk is highest if radiation treatment was used during puberty, when breasts are forming.     Radiation therapy to treat cancer in one breast does not appear to increase the risk of cancer in the other breast.    For women who have inherited changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes, exposure to radiation, such as that from chest x-rays, may further increase the risk of breast cancer, especially in women who were x-rayed before 20 years of age.       Obesity     Obesity increases the risk of breast cancer, especially in postmenopausal women who have not used hormone replacement therapy.       Drinking alcohol     Drinking alcohol increases the risk of breast cancer. The level of risk rises as the amount of alcohol consumed rises.
                
                
                    The following are protective factors for breast cancer:
                    Less exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body    Decreasing the length of time a woman's breast tissue is exposed to estrogen may help prevent breast cancer. Exposure to estrogen is reduced in the following ways:            -   Early pregnancy: Estrogen levels are lower during pregnancy. Women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have not had children or who give birth to their first child after age 35.     -  Breast-feeding: Estrogen levels may remain lower while a woman is breast-feeding. Women who breastfed have a lower risk of breast cancer than women who have had children but did not breastfeed.              Taking estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy, selective estrogen receptor modulators, or aromatase inhibitors and inactivators       Estrogen-only hormone therapy after hysterectomy     Hormone therapy with estrogen only may be given to women who have had a hysterectomy. In these women, estrogen-only therapy after menopause may decrease the risk of breast cancer. There is an increased risk of stroke and heart and blood vessel disease in postmenopausal women who take estrogen after a hysterectomy.          Selective estrogen receptor modulators      Tamoxifen and raloxifene belong to the family of drugs called selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs). SERMs act like estrogen on some tissues in the body, but block the effect of estrogen on other tissues.     Treatment with tamoxifen lowers the risk of estrogen receptor-positive (ER-positive) breast cancer and ductal carcinoma in situ in premenopausal and postmenopausal women at high risk. Treatment with raloxifene also lowers the risk of breast cancer in postmenopausal women. With either drug, the reduced risk lasts for several years or longer after treatment is stopped. Lower rates of broken bones have been noted in patients taking raloxifene.      Taking tamoxifen increases the risk of hot flashes, endometrial cancer, stroke, cataracts, and blood clots (especially in the lungs and legs). The risk of having these problems increases markedly in women older than 50 years compared with younger women. Women younger than 50 years who have a high risk of breast cancer may benefit the most from taking tamoxifen. The risk of having these problems decreases after tamoxifen is stopped. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.      Taking raloxifene increases the risk of blood clots in the lungs and legs, but does not appear to increase the risk of endometrial cancer. In postmenopausal women with osteoporosis (decreased bone density), raloxifene lowers the risk of breast cancer for women who have a high or low risk of breast cancer. It is not known if raloxifene would have the same effect in women who do not have osteoporosis. Talk with your doctor about the risks and benefits of taking this drug.     Other SERMs are being studied in clinical trials.          Aromatase inhibitors and inactivators      Aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole, letrozole) and inactivators (exemestane) lower the risk of recurrence and of new breast cancers in women who have a history of breast cancer. Aromatase inhibitors also decrease the risk of breast cancer in women with the following conditions:                -  Postmenopausal women with a personal history of breast cancer.      -  Women with no personal history of breast cancer who are 60 years and older, have a history of ductal carcinoma in situ with mastectomy, or have a high risk of breast cancer based on the Gail model tool (a tool used to estimate the risk of breast cancer).               In women with an increased risk of breast cancer, taking aromatase inhibitors decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body. Before menopause, estrogen is made by the ovaries and other tissues in a woman's body, including the brain, fat tissue, and skin. After menopause, the ovaries stop making estrogen, but the other tissues do not. Aromatase inhibitors block the action of an enzyme called aromatase, which is used to make all of the body's estrogen. Aromatase inactivators stop the enzyme from working.     Possible harms from taking aromatase inhibitors include muscle and joint pain, osteoporosis, hot flashes, and feeling very tired.           Risk-reducing mastectomy     Some women who have a high risk of breast cancer may choose to have a risk-reducing mastectomy (the removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer). The risk of breast cancer is much lower in these women and most feel less anxious about their risk of breast cancer. However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling about the different ways to prevent breast cancer before making this decision.       Ovarian ablation    The ovaries make most of the estrogen that is made by the body. Treatments that stop or lower the amount of estrogen made by the ovaries include surgery to remove the ovaries, radiation therapy, or taking certain drugs. This is called ovarian ablation.    Premenopausal women who have a high risk of breast cancer due to certain changes in the BRCA1 and BRCA2 genes may choose to have a risk-reducing oophorectomy (the removal of both ovaries when there are no signs of cancer). This decreases the amount of estrogen made by the body and lowers the risk of breast cancer. Risk-reducing oophorectomy also lowers the risk of breast cancer in normal premenopausal women and in women with an increased risk of breast cancer due to radiation to the chest. However, it is very important to have a cancer risk assessment and counseling before making this decision. The sudden drop in estrogen levels may cause the symptoms of menopause to begin. These include hot flashes, trouble sleeping, anxiety, and depression. Long-term effects include decreased sex drive, vaginal dryness, and decreased bone density.        Getting enough exercise    Women who exercise four or more hours a week have a lower risk of breast cancer. The effect of exercise on breast cancer risk may be greatest in premenopausal women who have normal or low body weight.
                
                
                    It is not clear whether the following affect the risk of breast cancer:
                    Oral contraceptives    Certain oral contraceptives contain estrogen. Some studies have shown that taking oral contraceptives (""the pill"") may slightly increase the risk of breast cancer in current users. This risk decreases over time. Other studies have not shown an increased risk of breast cancer in women who take oral contraceptives.     Progestin -only contraceptives that are injected or implanted do not appear to increase the risk of breast cancer. More studies are needed to know whether progestin-only oral contraceptives increase the risk of breast cancer.       Environment    Studies have not proven that being exposed to certain substances in the environment, such as chemicals, increases the risk of breast cancer.
                
                
                    Studies have shown that some factors do not affect the risk of breast cancer.
                    The following do not affect the risk of breast cancer:            - Having an abortion.     - Making diet changes such as eating less fat or more fruits and vegetables.     - Taking vitamins, including fenretinide (a type of vitamin A).     -  Cigarette smoking, both active and passive (inhaling secondhand smoke).     -  Using underarm deodorant or antiperspirant.     - Taking statins (cholesterol -lowering drugs).     - Taking bisphosphonates (drugs used to treat osteoporosis and hypercalcemia) by mouth or by intravenous infusion.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.   The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

Women with dense breasts have a higher risk of breast cancer compared to those with less dense breast tissue. Additionally, dense breast tissue can make it more challenging to detect cancer early through mammography, increasing the chance that cancer will be diagnosed at a later stage.

Proactive measures that women with dense breasts can take include discussing their breast density with their healthcare provider, who may recommend additional screening methods beyond standard mammograms, such as breast ultrasound or MRI, to ensure early detection. Women should also be vigilant about regular breast exams and maintaining awareness of any changes in their breasts.",519,"How does the density of breast tissue affect the likelihood of developing breast cancer, and what proactive measures can women take if they have dense breasts?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question about the impact of breast tissue density on breast cancer risk and outlines proactive measures women can take.

"un exposure and having a weak immune system can affect the risk of Merkel cell carcinoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for Merkel cell carcinoma include the following:         - Being exposed to a lot of natural sunlight.    - Being exposed to artificial sunlight, such as from tanning beds or psoralen and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy for psoriasis.    -  Having an immune system weakened by disease, such as chronic lymphocytic leukemia or HIV infection.     - Taking drugs that make the immune system less active, such as after an organ transplant.    -  Having a history of other types of cancer.    - Being older than 50 years, male, or white.","Yes, the use of tanning beds or therapies like PUVA (psoralen and ultraviolet A therapy) can increase the risk of developing Merkel Cell Carcinoma (MCC).

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - The location and size of the tumor.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).,"The tumor's location and size significantly impact the recovery chances for someone diagnosed with penile cancer as they are key factors in determining the stage of the cancer. The prognosis and treatment options depend on the stage, which is influenced by whether the tumor has spread to surrounding tissues, lymph nodes, or other areas of the body. Additionally, the size of the tumor can indicate the extent of disease progression. Larger tumors or those in more invasive locations often suggest a more advanced stage, which may lead to a poorer outlook and more complex treatment options.",60,In what ways do the tumor's location and size impact the recovery chances for someone diagnosed with penile cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the impact of the tumor's location and size on recovery chances, referencing how these factors influence the stage of cancer, which aligns with the original answer's focus on prognosis and treatment options.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether it has come back. External radiation therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors that have come back.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.

"Key Points
                    - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.    - There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.    - Age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.     - Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs.    Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)   Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information:         -  Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment         Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However, treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy.
                
                
                    There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
                    Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type. The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes:         - Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","The factors that might increase the risk of developing adult Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly concerning age and gender, include:

- Being in young or late adulthood: This means individuals who are younger (typically between 15 to 35 years old) or those who are older (often above 55 years) may be at greater risk.
- Being male: Males are generally at a higher risk compared to females when it comes to developing adult Hodgkin lymphoma. 

Additionally, other risk factors include infection with the Epstein-Barr virus and having a first-degree relative with Hodgkin lymphoma.",290,"What factors might increase the risk of developing adult Hodgkin lymphoma, particularly concerning age and gender?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding factors increasing the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma, specifically age and gender, and includes additional relevant factors such as Epstein-Barr virus infection and family history. This aligns well with the information in the original answer."
"Health history can affect the risk of testicular cancer.
	                    Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:          - Having had an undescended testicle.    - Having had abnormal development of the testicles.    - Having a personal history of testicular cancer.    - Having a family history of testicular cancer (especially in a father or brother).    - Being white.
	                
	                
	                    Treatment for testicular cancer can cause infertility.
	                    Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider sperm banking before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.","The connection between previous testicular conditions and the risk of testicular cancer is that certain conditions are established risk factors. Notably, having had an undescended testicle (cryptorchidism) significantly increases the risk of developing testicular cancer. Additionally, abnormal development of the testicles and having a personal history of testicular cancer are also linked to an elevated risk. These factors indicate that men with a history of testicular conditions should be monitored closely for signs of testicular cancer.",585,Can you explain the connection between previous testicular conditions and the risk of testicular cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the connection between previous testicular conditions and the risk of testicular cancer, mentioning relevant risk factors that were outlined in the original answer.

"Key Points
                    - After a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach and intestines or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the carcinoid tumor is found and whether it can be removed by surgery.
                
                
                    After a gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the stomach and intestines or to other parts of the body.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. The results of tests and procedures used to diagnose gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors may also be used for staging. See the General Information section for a description of these tests and procedures. A bone scan may be done to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if a gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumor spreads to the liver, the tumor cells in the liver are actually GI carcinoid tumor cells. The disease is metastatic GI carcinoid tumor, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The plan for cancer treatment depends on where the carcinoid tumor is found and whether it can be removed by surgery.
                    For many cancers it is important to know the stage of the cancer in order to plan treatment. However, the treatment of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors is not based on the stage of the cancer. Treatment depends mainly on whether the tumor can be removed by surgery and if the tumor has spread.   Treatment is based on whether the tumor:         - Can be completely removed by surgery.    - Has spread to other parts of the body.    - Has come back after treatment. The tumor may come back in the stomach or intestines or in other parts of the body.    - Has not gotten better with treatment.","The stage of cancer is not the main factor in determining treatment options for gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors because the treatment primarily depends on whether the tumor can be surgically removed and if it has spread to other parts of the body. Instead of focusing on the stage, the following factors are prioritized:

1. **Surgical Resectability**: Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.
2. **Spread of the Tumor**: If the tumor has metastasized (spread) to other parts of the body.
3. **Recurrence**: Whether the cancer has returned after treatment.
4. **Response to Previous Treatment**: If the tumor has not improved with prior treatments. 

These considerations are crucial in planning the most effective treatment strategies.",78,"Why is the stage of cancer not the main factor in determining treatment options for gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors, and what factors are prioritized instead?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects the main points from the original answer regarding why the stage of cancer is not the main determining factor for treatment options in gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.

Being female can increase the risk of developing gallbladder cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for gallbladder cancer include the following:         - Being female.    - Being Native American.,"In addition to gender, being Native American is indicated as a potential risk factor for gallbladder cancer.",248,"In addition to gender, what ethnic background is indicated as a potential risk factor for gallbladder cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question by stating that being Native American is a potential risk factor for gallbladder cancer, which aligns with the information provided in the original answer."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:          -  Whether the patient has HPV infection of the oropharynx.    - Whether the patient has a history of smoking cigarettes for ten or more pack years.     -  The stage of the cancer.    -  The number and size of lymph nodes with cancer.        Oropharyngeal tumors related to HPV infection have a better prognosis and are less likely to recur than tumors not linked to HPV infection.   Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Keeping the patient's ability to speak and swallow as normal as possible.    - The patient's general health.        Patients with oropharyngeal cancer have an increased risk of another cancer in the head or neck. This risk is increased in patients who continue to smoke or drink alcohol after treatment.   See the PDQ summary Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit for more information.,"Patients with oropharyngeal cancer are at an increased risk for developing another cancer in the head or neck due to shared risk factors such as a history of smoking, heavy alcohol use, and HPV infection, particularly HPV type 16. Patients who continue to smoke or consume alcohol after treatment face a heightened risk of recurrence or new cancers in this area. 

Lifestyle choices significantly impact this risk; avoiding tobacco and alcohol, as well as obtaining the HPV vaccination, can reduce the likelihood of developing oropharyngeal cancer and other related cancers. Quitting smoking, for instance, can decrease the risk by as much as 50% within five years, and after 20 years, the risk may align with that of non-smokers. Thus, making healthier lifestyle choices and reducing exposure to risk factors can play a crucial role in cancer prevention.",331,"Why are patients with oropharyngeal cancer at an increased risk for developing another cancer in the head or neck, and how can lifestyle choices impact this risk?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the increased risk of developing another cancer in the head or neck for patients with oropharyngeal cancer, citing shared risk factors like smoking and alcohol use, which aligns closely with the original answer.

Overall, the generated answer captures the key points and context from the original answer effectively."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects the inner lining of the rectum only, involves the whole rectum, or has spread to lymph nodes, nearby organs, or other places in the body).    - Whether the tumor has spread into or through the bowel wall.    - Where the cancer is found in the rectum.    - Whether the bowel is blocked or has a hole in it.    - Whether all of the tumor can be removed by surgery.    -  The patients general health.     - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).","The location of the tumor within the rectum influences treatment options and recovery outlook by affecting several key factors. These include the stage of the cancer, where the cancer is found in the rectum, whether the tumor has spread into or through the bowel wall, and if the bowel is blocked or has a hole in it. These factors impact the prognosis (chance of recovery) and determine whether all or part of the tumor can be surgically removed, which is critical for treatment. Additionally, the patient's general health and whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred also play a role in the treatment and recovery process. Therefore, the specific location of the tumor can significantly influence both the effectiveness of the treatment options and the overall outlook for recovery.",228,How does the location of the tumor within the rectum influence treatment options and recovery outlook?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about how the location of the tumor within the rectum influences treatment options and recovery outlook by detailing the relevant factors mentioned in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood astrocytomas. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health. This includes checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI). Sometimes magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) is done during the same MRI scan to look at the chemical makeup of the brain tissue.
                    Childhood astrocytomas are usually diagnosed and removed in surgery. If doctors think there may be an astrocytoma, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, a part of the skull is removed and a needle is used to remove tissue. Sometimes, the needle is guided by a computer. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. Because it can be hard to tell the difference between types of brain tumors, you may want to have your child's tissue sample checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing brain tumors.     The following test may be done on the tissue that was removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer. An MIB-1 test is a type of immunohistochemistry that checks tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This may show how fast a tumor is growing.        Sometimes tumors form in a place that makes them hard to remove. If removing the tumor may cause severe physical, emotional, or learning problems, a biopsy is done and more treatment is given after the biopsy.   Children who have NF1 may form a low-grade astrocytoma in the area of the brain that controls vision and may not need a biopsy. If the tumor does not continue to grow or symptoms do not occur, surgery to remove the tumor may not be needed.","Immunohistochemistry plays a crucial role in differentiating between types of childhood brain tumors by using antibodies to check for specific antigens in tissue samples. This test can help identify the unique characteristics of different tumors, allowing for accurate diagnosis. Within the context of childhood astrocytomas, immunohistochemistry can be employed to distinguish between various tumor types.

The MIB-1 test, which is a specific type of immunohistochemistry, assesses tumor tissue for an antigen called MIB-1. This test is valuable in understanding tumor growth rates; higher levels of MIB-1 may indicate that the tumor is growing more rapidly, providing insights into its aggressiveness and potential behavior.",281,"What role does immunohistochemistry play in differentiating between types of childhood brain tumors, and how does the MIB-1 test contribute to understanding tumor growth rates?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the role of immunohistochemistry and the MIB-1 test in differentiating between types of childhood brain tumors, precisely as outlined in the original answer.

The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the brain or to other parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard system for staging childhood craniopharyngioma. Craniopharyngioma is described as newly diagnosed disease or recurrent disease. The results of the tests and procedures done to diagnose craniopharyngioma are used to help make decisions about treatment.,"To determine if childhood craniopharyngioma has metastasized, particularly within the brain, the process of staging is utilized, although there is no standard system for staging this type of tumor. The evaluation primarily involves diagnostic imaging tests, such as MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and CT scans (computed tomography), which can help visualize the tumor and assess if it has affected surrounding brain structures. Additionally, the results of various tests used to diagnose craniopharyngioma assist in making treatment decisions. 

However, it's important to note that craniopharyngiomas are classified as benign tumors, meaning they typically do not metastasize or spread to other parts of the brain or body, but they can grow and exert pressure on nearby structures. Therefore, assessing their growth and progression rather than traditional metastatic spread is critical in the management of childhood craniopharyngioma.",140,"What methods are used to determine if childhood craniopharyngioma has metastasized, particularly within the brain?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the process of staging in relation to childhood craniopharyngioma, mentions the lack of a standard staging system, and explains the importance of diagnostic imaging in assessing the tumor.

                    Childhood kidney tumors are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the kidney.
                    There are two kidneys, one on each side of the backbone, above the waist. Tiny tubules in the kidneys filter and clean the blood. They take out waste products and make urine. The urine passes from each kidney through a long tube called a ureter into the bladder. The bladder holds the urine until it passes through the urethra and leaves the body.
                
                
                    There are many types of childhood kidney tumors.
                    Wilms Tumor    In Wilms tumor, one or more tumors may be found in one or both kidneys. Wilms tumor may spread to the lungs, liver, bone, brain, or nearby lymph nodes. In children and adolescents younger than 15 years old, most kidney cancers are Wilms tumors.        Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)     Renal cell cancer is rare in children and adolescents younger than 15 years old. It is much more common in adolescents between 15 and 19 years old. Children and adolescents are more likely to be diagnosed with a large renal cell tumor or cancer that has spread. Renal cell cancers may spread to the lungs, liver, or lymph nodes. Renal cell cancer may also be called renal cell carcinoma.       Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney     Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney is a type of kidney cancer that occurs mostly in infants and young children. It is often advanced at the time of diagnosis. Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney grows and spreads quickly, often to the lungs or brain.    Children with a certain change in the SMARCB1 gene are checked regularly to see if a rhabdoid tumor has formed in the kidney or has spread to the brain:            - Children younger than one year old have an ultrasound of the abdomen every two to three months and an ultrasound of the head every month.     - Children one to four years old have an ultrasound of the abdomen and an MRI of the brain and spine every three months.              Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney     Clear cell sarcoma of the kidney is a type of kidney tumor that may spread to the lung, bone, brain, or soft tissue. When it recurs (comes back) after treatment, it often recurs in the brain or lung.       Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma     Congenital mesoblastic nephroma is a tumor of the kidney that is often diagnosed during the first year of life. It can usually be cured.        Ewing Sarcoma of the Kidney     Ewing sarcoma (previously called neuroepithelial tumor) of the kidney is rare and usually occurs in young adults. These tumors grow and spread to other parts of the body quickly.       Primary Renal Myoepithelial Carcinoma     Primary renal myoepithelial carcinoma is a rare type of cancer that usually affects soft tissues, but sometimes forms in the internal organs (such as the kidney). This type of cancer grows and spreads quickly.       Cystic Partially Differentiated Nephroblastoma      Cystic partially differentiated nephroblastoma is a very rare type of Wilms tumor made up of cysts.       Multilocular Cystic Nephroma     Multilocular cystic nephromas are benign tumors made up of cysts and are most common in infants, young children, and adult women. These tumors can occur in one or both kidneys.     Children with this type of tumor also may have pleuropulmonary blastoma, so imaging tests that check the lungs for cysts or solid tumors are done. Since multilocular cystic nephroma may be an inherited condition, genetic counseling and genetic testing may be considered. See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for more information about pleuropulmonary blastoma.       Primary Renal Synovial Sarcoma     Primary renal synovial sarcoma is a cyst-like tumor of the kidney and is most common in young adults. These tumors grow and spread quickly.       Anaplastic Sarcoma of the Kidney      Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney is a rare tumor that is most common in children or adolescents younger than 15 years of age. Anaplastic sarcoma of the kidney often spreads to the lungs, liver, or bones. Imaging tests that check the lungs for cysts or solid tumors may be done. Since anaplastic sarcoma may be an inherited condition, genetic counseling and genetic testing may be considered.
                
                
                    Nephroblastomatosis is not cancer but may become Wilms tumor.
                    Sometimes, after the kidneys form in the fetus, abnormal groups of kidney cells remain in one or both kidneys. In nephroblastomatosis (diffuse hyperplastic perilobar nephroblastomatosis), these abnormal groups of cells may grow in many places inside the kidney or make a thick layer around the kidney. When these groups of abnormal cells are found in a kidney after it was removed for Wilms tumor, the child has an increased risk of Wilms tumor in the other kidney. Frequent follow-up testing is important at least every 3 months, for at least 7 years after the child is treated.
                
                
                    Treatment for Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors may include genetic counseling.
                    Genetic counseling (a discussion with a trained professional about genetic diseases and whether genetic testing is needed) may be needed if the child has one of the following syndromes or conditions:          - A genetic syndrome or condition that increases the risk of Wilms tumor.    - An inherited condition that increases the risk of renal cell cancer.    -  Rhabdoid tumor of the kidney.    - Multilocular cystic nephroma.","The different types of childhood kidney tumors include:

1. **Wilms Tumor**: This is the most common type of kidney cancer in children and can appear in one or both kidneys. It may metastasize to the lungs, liver, bones, brain, or lymph nodes.  

2. **Renal Cell Cancer (RCC)**: This type is rare in children under 15 and more prevalent in adolescents aged 15 to 19, often presenting as large tumors or already metastatic disease.

3. **Rhabdoid Tumor of the Kidney**: Primarily occurring in infants and young children, this tumor tends to be aggressive, often diagnosed at an advanced stage, with a high likelihood of spreading to the lungs and brain.

4. **Clear Cell Sarcoma of the Kidney**: This tumor can spread to the lungs, bones, brain, or soft tissues, with a tendency to recur in the brain or lung after treatment.

5. **Congenital Mesoblastic Nephroma**: Typically diagnosed in the first year of life, this tumor is generally curable.

"Tests that examine the skin, lungs, and gastrointestinal tract are used to detect (find) and diagnose Kaposi sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking skin and lymph nodes for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma in the lungs.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer.  One of the following types of biopsies may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the skin:               -  Excisional biopsy : A scalpel is used to remove the entire skin growth.       -  Incisional biopsy : A scalpel is used to remove part of a skin growth.      -  Core biopsy : A wide needle is used to remove part of a skin growth.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : A thin needle is used to remove part of a skin growth.          An endoscopy or bronchoscopy may be done to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract or lungs.               - Endoscopy for biopsy: A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract.      - Bronchoscopy for biopsy: A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This is used to find Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the lungs.
                           - After Kaposi sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body. The following tests and procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the lung, liver, and spleen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This imaging test checks for signs of cancer in the lung, liver, and spleen.    -   CD34 lymphocyte count: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amount of CD34 cells (a type of white blood cell). A lower than normal amount of CD34 cells can be a sign the immune system is not working well.","Endoscopy and bronchoscopy procedures are essential in diagnosing Kaposi sarcoma lesions in specific areas of the body, namely the gastrointestinal tract and lungs. 

- **Endoscopy for gastrointestinal tract:** This procedure involves the insertion of an endoscope, a thin, tube-like instrument equipped with a light and lens, through an opening in the body (such as the mouth) to examine the organs and tissues within the gastrointestinal tract. It allows doctors to identify abnormal areas and to take tissue samples or lymph node samples for microscopic examination to check for signs of Kaposi sarcoma lesions.

- **Bronchoscopy for lungs:** Similarly, bronchoscopy involves inserting a bronchoscope, which is also a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and lens, through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. This allows for direct visualization of the large airways in the lungs and the ability to obtain tissue samples to check for Kaposi sarcoma lesions.

Both procedures enable the effective identification and confirmation of Kaposi sarcoma in these two vital areas, facilitating timely and appropriate treatment.",623,"How do endoscopy and bronchoscopy procedures aid in the diagnosis of Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, respectively?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of how endoscopy and bronchoscopy procedures are used to diagnose Kaposi sarcoma lesions in the gastrointestinal tract and lungs, aligning closely with the details from the original answer.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the hypopharynx, involves the whole hypopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body). Hypopharyngeal cancer is usually detected in later stages because early signs and symptoms rarely occur.    - The patient's age, gender, and general health.     - The location of the cancer.    - Whether the patient smokes during radiation therapy.        Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.    - The patient's general health.        Patients who have had hypopharyngeal cancer are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck.

		                Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect (find) and diagnose early.
		                Pancreatic cancer is difficult to detect and diagnose for the following reasons:         - There arent any noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages of pancreatic cancer.    - The signs and symptoms of pancreatic cancer, when present, are like the signs and symptoms of many other illnesses.    - The pancreas is hidden behind other organs such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts.","The anatomical position of the pancreas significantly affects the ability to detect pancreatic cancer during a physical examination due to several factors:

1. **Location and Accessibility**: The pancreas is situated behind other organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, liver, gallbladder, spleen, and bile ducts. This position makes it less accessible during a physical exam, making it challenging for doctors to palpate or visually assess the organ for abnormalities.

2. **Lack of Early Symptoms**: Pancreatic cancer often does not present noticeable signs or symptoms in the early stages. Because of its deep anatomical placement and the absence of early symptoms, it can remain undetected until it reaches a more advanced stage.

3. **Symptoms Resembling Other Conditions**: When symptoms do manifest, they are often nonspecific and overlap with those of many other illnesses, such as abdominal pain, weight loss, and jaundice. This can lead to misdiagnosis or delay in recognizing pancreatic cancer specifically during a physical examination.

4. **Deep Location**: The pancreas lies between the stomach and the spine, making it particularly difficult to examine through standard physical examination techniques. This deep location hinders the ability to identify lumps or masses that may indicate cancerous growth.

Overall, the hidden location, nonspecific symptoms, and similarity of signs to other conditions contribute to the challenges in the early detection of pancreatic cancer during physical examinations.",673,In what ways does the anatomical position of the pancreas affect the ability to detect pancreatic cancer during a physical examination?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the question about how the anatomical position of the pancreas affects the detection of pancreatic cancer, which directly relates to the original answer's discussion on the difficulties of detecting and diagnosing pancreatic cancer due to the pancreas's position and the nonspecific nature of its symptoms.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and whether it has come back. External radiation therapy is being studied for the treatment of childhood extracranial germ cell tumors that have come back.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with hairy cell leukemia.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with hairy cell leukemia. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patient's condition, without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. Cladribine and pentostatin are anticancer drugs commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia. These drugs may increase the risk of other types of cancer, especially Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Long-term follow up for second cancers is very important.       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a cancer treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Interferon alfa is a biologic agent commonly used to treat hairy cell leukemia.    See Drugs Approved for Hairy Cell Leukemia for more information.       Surgery      Splenectomy is a surgical procedure to remove the spleen.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat hairy cell leukemia.    Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    A monoclonal antibody called rituximab may be used for certain patients with hairy cell leukemia.    Other types of targeted therapies are being studied.

                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with adult primary liver cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Patients with liver cancer are treated by a team of specialists who are experts in treating liver cancer.
                    The patient's treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer. The medical oncologist may refer the patient to other health professionals who have special training in treating patients with liver cancer. These may include the following specialists:         - Hepatologist (specialist in liver disease).    -  Surgical oncologist.    -  Transplant surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    - Interventional radiologist (a specialist who diagnoses and treats diseases using imaging and the smallest incisions possible).    -  Pathologist.
                
                
                    Seven types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surveillance     Surveillance for lesions smaller than 1 centimeter found during screening. Follow-up every three months is common.       Surgery    A partial hepatectomy (surgery to remove the part of the liver where cancer is found) may be done. A wedge of tissue, an entire lobe, or a larger part of the liver, along with some of the healthy tissue around it is removed. The remaining liver tissue takes over the functions of the liver and may regrow.       Liver transplant    In a liver transplant, the entire liver is removed and replaced with a healthy donated liver. A liver transplant may be done when the disease is in the liver only and a donated liver can be found. If the patient has to wait for a donated liver, other treatment is given as needed.       Ablation therapy     Ablation therapy removes or destroys tissue. Different types of ablation therapy are used for liver cancer:            -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of special needles that are inserted directly through the skin or through an incision in the abdomen to reach the tumor. High-energy radio waves heat the needles and tumor which kills cancer cells.     -  Microwave therapy: A type of treatment in which the tumor is exposed to high temperatures created by microwaves. This can damage and kill cancer cells or make them more sensitive to the effects of radiation and certain anticancer drugs.      -  Percutaneous ethanol injection: A cancer treatment in which a small needle is used to inject ethanol (pure alcohol) directly into a tumor to kill cancer cells. Several treatments may be needed. Usually local anesthesia is used, but if the patient has many tumors in the liver, general anesthesia may be used.      -  Cryoablation: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy cancer cells. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy and cryosurgery. The doctor may use ultrasound to guide the instrument.     -  Electroporation therapy: A treatment that sends electrical pulses through an electrode placed in a tumor to kill cancer cells. Electroporation therapy is being studied in clinical trials.              Embolization therapy     Embolization therapy is the use of substances to block or decrease the flow of blood through the hepatic artery to the tumor. When the tumor does not get the oxygen and nutrients it needs, it will not continue to grow. Embolization therapy is used for patients who cannot have surgery to remove the tumor or ablation therapy and whose tumor has not spread outside the liver.    The liver receives blood from the hepatic portal vein and the hepatic artery. Blood that comes into the liver from the hepatic portal vein usually goes to the healthy liver tissue. Blood that comes from the hepatic artery usually goes to the tumor. When the hepatic artery is blocked during embolization therapy, the healthy liver tissue continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein.     There are two main types of embolization therapy:            -  Transarterial embolization (TAE): A small incision (cut) is made in the inner thigh and a catheter (thin, flexible tube) is inserted and threaded up into the hepatic artery. Once the catheter is in place, a substance that blocks the hepatic artery and stops blood flow to the tumor is injected.     -  Transarterial chemoembolization (TACE): This procedure is like TAE except an anticancer drug is also given. The procedure can be done by attaching the anticancer drug to small beads that are injected into the hepatic artery or by injecting the anticancer drug through the catheter into the hepatic artery and then injecting the substance to block the hepatic artery. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. This type of treatment is also called chemoembolization.              Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Adult liver cancer may be treated with a targeted therapy drug that stops cells from dividing and prevents the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.     See Drugs Approved for Liver Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor. This allows a high dose of radiation to reach the tumor and causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.       -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.       -  Proton beam radiation therapy: Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy. A radiation therapy machine aims streams of protons (tiny, invisible, positively-charged particles) at the cancer cells to kill them. This type of treatment causes less damage to nearby healthy tissue.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult primary liver cancer.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

The key specialists and their roles are as follows:

1. **Medical Oncologist**: This doctor specializes in treating cancer and oversees the overall treatment plan, coordinating with other specialists as needed.

2. **Hepatologist**: A specialist in liver diseases, the hepatologist assesses liver function and manages any liver-related complications that may arise during treatment.

3. **Surgical Oncologist**: This surgeon focuses on removing tumors from the liver. Depending on the stage of cancer, they may perform partial or total hepatectomies to eliminate the cancerous tissues.

4. **Transplant Surgeon**: If a liver transplant is needed, the transplant surgeon evaluates the patient for eligibility and performs the transplant procedure.

5. **Radiation Oncologist**: This specialist administers radiation therapy to target cancer cells, particularly in advanced stages or when surgery is not possible.

6. **Interventional Radiologist**: This expert uses imaging techniques to guide minimally invasive procedures such as embolization therapy, aimed at blocking tumor blood supply.

7. **Pathologist**: The pathologist analyzes tissue samples from biopsies to confirm the diagnosis and provide information about the cancer type and characteristics.

The collaboration among these specialists is vital for developing a tailored treatment plan based on the cancer’s stage and the patient's overall health. They work together to ensure that treatment approaches—whether surgery, chemotherapy, embolization, or liver transplantation—are integrated effectively to optimize patient outcomes. Regular communication among the team allows for adjustments to the treatment plan as needed based on the patient's response and ongoing assessment.",533,"What are the specific roles of the specialists involved in the treatment of adult primary liver cancer, and how do they collaborate in the patient's care?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the roles of the specialists involved in the treatment of adult primary liver cancer and emphasizes their collaborative approach in patient care.

                    - Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts.     - Having colitis or certain liver diseases can increase the risk of bile duct cancer.    - Signs of bile duct cancer include jaundice and pain in the abdomen.    - Tests that examine the bile ducts and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer.    - Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer.     - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Bile duct cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the bile ducts.
                    A network of tubes, called ducts, connects the liver, gallbladder, and small intestine. This network begins in the liver where many small ducts collect bile (a fluid made by the liver to break down fats during digestion). The small ducts come together to form the right and left hepatic ducts, which lead out of the liver. The two ducts join outside the liver and form the common hepatic duct. The cystic duct connects the gallbladder to the common hepatic duct. Bile from the liver passes through the hepatic ducts, common hepatic duct, and cystic duct and is stored in the gallbladder.    When food is being digested, bile stored in the gallbladder is released and passes through the cystic duct to the common bile duct and into the small intestine.    Bile duct cancer is also called cholangiocarcinoma.   There are two types of bile duct cancer:         -   Intrahepatic bile duct cancer : This type of cancer forms in the bile ducts inside the liver. Only a small number of bile duct cancers are intrahepatic. Intrahepatic bile duct cancers are also called intrahepatic cholangiocarcinomas.    -   Extrahepatic bile duct cancer : The extrahepatic bile duct is made up of the hilum region and the distal region. Cancer can form in either region:                - Perihilar bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the hilum region, the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and join to form the common hepatic duct. Perihilar bile duct cancer is also called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.      - Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer: This type of cancer is found in the distal region. The distal region is made up of the common bile duct which passes through the pancreas and ends in the small intestine. Distal extrahepatic bile duct cancer is also called extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.","Bile duct cancer, also known as cholangiocarcinoma, is categorized into two main types based on the location of the cancer within the bile duct system:

1. **Intrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer**: This type of cancer forms within the bile ducts that are located inside the liver. It is less common compared to extrahepatic bile duct cancers and is referred to specifically as intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

2. **Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer**: This type of cancer originates in the bile ducts outside the liver and is further divided into two regions:
   - **Perihilar Bile Duct Cancer**: This cancer is located in the hilum region, which is the area where the right and left bile ducts exit the liver and converge to form the common hepatic duct. It is often called a Klatskin tumor or perihilar cholangiocarcinoma.
   - **Distal Extrahepatic Bile Duct Cancer**: This cancer occurs in the distal region, specifically in the common bile duct that travels through the pancreas and leads to the small intestine. It is referred to as extrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation is a risk factor for skin cancer.
                    Some studies suggest that being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and the sensitivity of a persons skin to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Risk factors for nonmelanoma skin cancer:                  - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                       - Having actinic keratosis.        - Past treatment with radiation.       - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.                -  Risk factors for melanoma skin cancer:                  - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.         - Red or blond hair.                      - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.       - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).       - Having a family or personal history of melanoma.        - Being white.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:
                    Sunscreen use and avoiding sun exposure    It is not known if nonmelanoma skin cancer risk is decreased by staying out of the sun, using sunscreens, or wearing protective clothing when outdoors. This is because not enough studies have been done to prove this.    Sunscreen may help decrease the amount of UV radiation to the skin. One study found that wearing sunscreen can help prevent actinic keratoses, scaly patches of skin that sometimes become squamous cell carcinoma.     The harms of using sunscreen are likely to be small and include allergic reactions to skin creams and lower levels of vitamin D made in the skin because of less sun exposure.     It is also possible that when a person uses sunscreen to avoid sunburn they may spend too much time in the sun and be exposed to harmful UV radiation.    Although protecting the skin and eyes from the sun has not been proven to lower the chance of getting skin cancer, skin experts suggest the following:            -  Use sunscreen that protects against UV radiation.     -  Do not stay out in the sun for long periods of time, especially when the sun is at its strongest.     -  Wear long sleeve shirts, long pants, sun hats, and sunglasses, when outdoors.              Chemopreventive agents     Chemoprevention is the use of drugs, vitamins, or other agents to try to reduce the risk of cancer. The following chemopreventive agents have been studied to find whether they lower the risk of nonmelanoma skin cancer:         Beta carotene      Studies of beta carotene (taken as a supplement in pills) have not shown that it prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.            Isotretinoin      High doses of isotretinoin have been shown to prevent new skin cancers in patients with xeroderma pigmentosum. However, isotretinoin has not been shown to prevent nonmelanoma skin cancers from coming back in patients previously treated for nonmelanoma skin cancers. Treatment with isotretinoin can cause serious side effects.            Selenium      Studies have shown that selenium (taken in brewer's yeast tablets) does not lower the risk of basal cell carcinoma, and may increase the risk of squamous cell carcinoma.            Celecoxib      A study of celecoxib in patients with actinic keratosis and a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer found those who took celecoxib had slightly lower rates of recurrent nonmelanoma skin cancers. Celecoxib may have serious side effects on the heart and blood vessels.             Alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO)      A study of alpha-difluoromethylornithine (DFMO) in patients with a history of nonmelanoma skin cancer showed that those who took DFMO had lower rates of nonmelanoma skin cancers coming back than those who took a placebo. DFMO may cause hearing loss which is usually temporary.            Nicotinamide (vitamin B3)      Studies have shown that nicotinamide (vitamin B3) helps prevent new actinic keratoses lesions from forming in people who had four or fewer actinic lesions before taking nicotinamide. More studies are needed to find out if nicotinamide prevents nonmelanoma skin cancer from forming or coming back.
                
                
                    It is not known if the following lower the risk of melanoma:
                    Sunscreen    It has not been proven that using sunscreen to prevent sunburn can protect against melanoma caused by UV radiation. Other risk factors such as having skin that burns easily, having a large number of benign moles, or having atypical nevi may also play a role in whether melanoma forms.       Counseling and protecting the skin from the sun    It is not known if people who receive counseling or information about avoiding sun exposure make changes in their behavior to protect their skin from the sun.","The risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancer differ significantly, especially in relation to sun exposure and skin type. 

**Nonmelanoma Skin Cancer Risk Factors:**
- **Sun Exposure:** Extended exposure to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (like tanning beds) over long periods increases the risk.
- **Skin Type:** Individuals with a fair complexion (fair skin that freckles, burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly), light-colored eyes (blue, green, or other light colors), and red or blond hair are at higher risk.
- Other factors include having actinic keratosis, past radiation treatment, a weakened immune system, and exposure to arsenic.

**Melanoma Skin Cancer Risk Factors:**
- **Sun Exposure:** Similar to nonmelanoma, prolonged exposure to natural or artificial sunlight is a risk.
- **Skin Type:** Individuals with fair skin that burns easily and doesn't tan, along with light-colored eyes and red or blond hair, are also at increased risk.
- Additionally, specific factors heightening melanoma risk include a history of many blistering sunburns, particularly in childhood or adolescence, having several large or many small moles, or a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome) or melanoma.

In summary, while both types of skin cancer share common risk factors related to skin type and sun exposure, melanoma also has additional distinct factors related to blistering sunburn history and mole characteristics.",207,"Can you explain the differences in risk factors for nonmelanoma versus melanoma skin cancer, particularly in relation to sun exposure and skin type?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and differentiates the risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma skin cancers in relation to sun exposure and skin type, consistent with the key points in the original answer.

"A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer.
                    Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for breast cancer.    Risk factors for breast cancer include the following:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.     - A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister).     - Inherited changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes or in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.     - Breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram.     -  Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body. This may be caused by:                  -  Menstruating at an early age.       -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth.       - Starting menopause at a later age.                - Taking hormones such as estrogen combined with progestin for symptoms of menopause.     - Treatment with radiation therapy to the breast/chest.     - Drinking alcohol.     -  Obesity.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.      NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider. For more information on breast cancer risk, call 1-800-4-CANCER.","Having a family history of breast cancer, particularly in a first-degree relative (such as a mother, daughter, or sister), increases the risk of developing breast cancer.

                    - Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.    - There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.    - Age, gender, and Epstein-Barr infection can affect the risk of adult Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Signs of adult Hodgkin lymphoma include swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.     - Tests that examine the lymph nodes are used to detect (find) and diagnose adult Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. It is located on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin. Cancer can spread to the liver and lungs.    Lymphomas are divided into two general types: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. This summary is about the treatment of adult Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)   Hodgkin lymphoma can occur in both adults and children. Treatment for adults is different than treatment for children. Hodgkin lymphoma may also occur in patients who have acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS); these patients require special treatment.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information:         -  Childhood Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  AIDS-Related Lymphoma Treatment         Hodgkin lymphoma in pregnant women is the same as the disease in nonpregnant women of childbearing age. However, treatment is different for pregnant women. This summary includes information about treating Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy.
                
                
                    There are two main types of Hodgkin lymphoma: classical and nodular lymphocyte-predominant.
                    Most Hodgkin lymphomas are the classical type. The classical type is broken down into the following four subtypes:         - Nodular sclerosing Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte depletion Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.","Common symptoms indicating the presence of adult Hodgkin lymphoma that patients should be vigilant about include:

1. Painless, swollen lymph nodes in the neck, underarm, or groin.
2. Fever for no known reason.
3. Drenching night sweats.
4. Weight loss for no known reason.
5. Itchy skin.
6. Feeling very tired.

Patients experiencing these symptoms that do not go away should consult with their doctor.",290,What are the common symptoms indicating the presence of adult Hodgkin lymphoma that patients should be vigilant about?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about common symptoms of adult Hodgkin lymphoma, providing a list of symptoms that align closely with those mentioned in the original answer, such as swollen lymph nodes, fever, night sweats, and weight loss.

                    After small cell lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the chest or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the chest or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)    Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:         -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) of the brain: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain, chest or upper abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. A PET scan and CT scan may be done at the same time. This is called a PET-CT.    -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. The disease is metastatic small cell lung cancer, not brain cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for small cell lung cancer:
                    Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer    In limited-stage, cancer is in the lung where it started and may have spread to the area between the lungs or to the lymph nodes above the collarbone.        Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer    In extensive-stage, cancer has spread beyond the lung or the area between the lungs or the lymph nodes above the collarbone to other places in the body.","The staging of small cell lung cancer significantly impacts treatment decisions for patients. There are two main stages: Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer and Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer.

1. **Limited-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer**: In this stage, the cancer is confined to the lung where it started and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Treatment options for this stage may include:
   - Combination chemotherapy and radiation therapy to the chest.
   - Combination chemotherapy alone if radiation therapy is not feasible.
   - Surgery followed by chemotherapy or combined with radiation therapy.
   - Radiation therapy to the brain, especially for patients with a complete response, to prevent further spread.

2. **Extensive-Stage Small Cell Lung Cancer**: In this stage, the cancer has spread beyond the lung and lymph nodes to other parts of the body. Treatment options for this stage primarily include:
   - Combination chemotherapy.
   - Palliative radiation therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.
   - Radiation therapy to the brain for patients with a complete response to chemotherapy.

The stage of the cancer influences the treatment modality chosen, as well as the potential outcomes and the need for supportive therapies. Understanding the stage helps in tailoring the most effective treatment approach for the patient.",40,How does the staging of small cell lung cancer impact treatment decisions for patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of staging on treatment decisions for small cell lung cancer, which was a question derived from the original answer. It accurately describes both the limited and extensive stages of small cell lung cancer and outlines the treatment options for each stage, which aligns well with the key points provided in the original answer. Thus, the response maintains high relevance."

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with childhood soft tissue sarcoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with childhood soft tissue sarcoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with soft tissue sarcoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include a pediatric surgeon with special training in the removal of soft tissue sarcomas. The following specialists may also be included:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric hematologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Child-life specialist.
                
                
                    Treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:          - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information.)
                
                
                    Eight types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to completely remove the soft tissue sarcoma is done when possible. If the tumor is very large, radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given first, to make the tumor smaller and decrease the amount of tissue that needs to be removed during surgery. This is called neoadjuvant therapy.    The following types of surgery may be used:            -  Wide local excision: Removal of the tumor along with some normal tissue around it.      -  Amputation: Surgery to remove all or part of the limb or appendage with cancer, such as the arm or hand.     -  Lymphadenectomy: Removal of the lymph nodes with cancer.      -  Mohs surgery: A surgical procedure used to treat cancer in the skin. Individual layers of cancer tissue are removed and checked under a microscope one at a time until all cancer tissue has been removed. This type of surgery is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans. It is also called Mohs micrographic surgery.     -  Hepatectomy: Surgery to remove all or part of the liver.           A second surgery may be needed to:            - Remove any remaining cancer cells.     - Check the area around where the tumor was removed for cancer cells and then remove more tissue if needed.           If cancer is in the liver, a hepatectomy and liver transplant may be done (the liver is removed and replaced with a healthy one from a donor).    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. This type of radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Stereotactic body radiation therapy: Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy. Special equipment is used to place the patient in the same position for each radiation treatment. Once a day for several days, a radiation machine aims a larger than usual dose of radiation directly at the tumor. By having the patient in the same position for each treatment, there is less damage to nearby healthy tissue. This procedure is also called stereotactic external-beam radiation therapy and stereotaxic radiation therapy.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated and whether the tumor was completely removed by surgery. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat childhood soft tissue sarcoma.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated.     Most types of soft tissue sarcoma do not respond to treatment with chemotherapy.    See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Observation may be done when:             - Complete removal of the tumor is not possible.     - No other treatments are available.     - The tumor is not likely to damage any vital organs.              Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working. Antiestrogens (drugs that block estrogen), such as tamoxifen, may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis.       Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs     Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) are drugs (such as aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen) that are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. In the treatment of desmoid-type fibromatosis, an NSAID called sulindac may be used to help block the growth of cancer cells.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation do.     Kinase inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that block an enzyme called kinase (a type of protein). There are different types of kinases in the body that have different actions.             -  ALK inhibitors may stop the cancer from growing and spreading:                  -  Crizotinib may be used to treat inflammatory myofibroblastic tumor.                -  Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) block signals needed for tumors to grow:                   -  Imatinib is used to treat dermatofibrosarcoma protuberans.       -  Pazopanib may be used to treat recurrent and progressive soft tissue sarcoma. It is being studied for many types of newly diagnosed soft tissue sarcoma.       - Sorafenib may be used to treat desmoid-type fibromatosis.                      New types of tyrosine kinase inhibitors are being studied such as LOXO-101 and entrectinib for infantile fibrosarcoma.    Other types of targeted therapy are being studied in clinical trials, including the following:            -  mTOR inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that stops the protein that helps cells divide and survive. mTOR inhibitors are being studied to treat perivascular epithelioid cell tumors (PEComas) and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Sirolimus is a type of mTOR inhibitor therapy.      -  Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy that prevent the growth of new blood vessels needed for tumors to grow. Angiogenesis inhibitors, such as cediranib, sunitinib, and thalidomide are being studied to treat alveolar soft part sarcoma and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. Bevacizumab is being studied for blood vessel tumors.     -  Histone methyltransferase (HMT) inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that work inside cancer cells and block signals needed for tumors to grow. HMT inhibitors are being studied for the treatment of epithelioid sarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, extrarenal (extracranial) rhabdoid tumor, extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma, and synovial sarcoma.      -  Heat-shock protein inhibitors block certain proteins that protect tumor cells and help them grow. Ganetespib is a heat shock protein inhibitor being studied in combination with the mTOR inhibitor sirolimus for malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors that cannot be removed by surgery.     -  Antibody-drug conjugates are made up of a monoclonal antibody attached to a drug. The monoclonal antibody binds to specific proteins or receptors found on certain cells, including cancer cells. The drug enters these cells and kills them without harming other cells. Lorvotuzumab mertansine is an antibody-drug conjugate being studied for the treatment of rhabdomyosarcoma, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumor, and synovial sarcoma.           See Drugs Approved for Soft Tissue Sarcoma for more information.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease.     Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat epithelioid hemangioendothelioma. It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth.
                         
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

**Neoadjuvant therapy** refers to treatments given before the main surgery. Its primary goal is to shrink the tumor size to facilitate the surgical removal and minimize the amount of tissue that needs to be excised during the procedure. For example, if the tumor is very large, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be administered first to make the tumor smaller.

**Adjuvant therapy**, on the other hand, is the treatment given after surgery. The purpose of adjuvant therapy is to eliminate any remaining cancer cells that may not have been removed during surgery, thereby lowering the risk of the cancer returning. This can also involve radiation therapy or chemotherapy, depending on the specifics of the case.

In summary, neoadjuvant therapy is used before surgery to reduce tumor size, while adjuvant therapy is used after surgery to eradicate residual cancer cells.",509,Can you explain the differences between neoadjuvant therapy and adjuvant therapy in the context of surgery for childhood soft tissue sarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the concepts of neoadjuvant and adjuvant therapy within the context of surgical treatment for childhood soft tissue sarcoma.

"Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen and liver. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells and platelets.       - The number and type of white blood cells.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.       - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views both the bone and bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.  The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. The cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms do not contain the Philadelphia chromosome that is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia.      -  Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of bone marrow. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the cells in the sample to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to tell the difference between myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia, and other conditions.","During a physical exam and patient history, the following information can be gathered that may reveal signs of myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms:

1. **General Signs of Health**: The exam will check for any overall signs of disease, including:
   - **Enlarged Spleen**: An enlarged spleen may indicate an abnormal increase in blood cells.
   - **Enlarged Liver**: This can also suggest issues with blood cell production or myeloproliferative disorders.

2. **Patient History**: This includes collecting information about the patient’s health habits, past illnesses, and treatments, which can provide insight into potential risk factors or symptoms related to myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms.

                    After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
                
                
                    The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma:
                    Small    The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.           Medium    The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.       Large    The tumor is:            - more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or     - at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.            Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.
                    Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems. The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed:         -  Iris.    -  Ciliary body and choroid.         If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris.       Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA, the tumor:                   - is in the iris only and is more than one fourth the size of the iris; or       - is in the iris only and has caused glaucoma; or       - has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both. The tumor has caused glaucoma.                - In stage IIB, the tumor has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both, and has also spread into the sclera. The tumor has caused glaucoma.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.            - In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick.     - In stage IIIB, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick.              Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread:            - to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid:
                    Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the tumor is.

Category 1:         - The tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 9 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick.        Category 2:         - The tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick.        Category 3:         - The tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 3.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 9.1 to 12 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 12.1 to 15 millimeters thick.

                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Most pregnant women with breast cancer have surgery to remove the breast. Some of the  lymph nodes under the arm may be removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    Types of surgery to remove the cancer include:            -  Modified radical mastectomy: Surgery to remove the whole breast that has cancer, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes, part of the chest wall muscles. This type of surgery is most common in pregnant women.     -  Breast-conserving surgery: Surgery to remove the cancer and some normal tissue around it, but not the breast itself. Part of the chest wall lining may also be removed if the cancer is near it. This type of surgery may also be called lumpectomy, partial mastectomy, segmental mastectomy, quadrantectomy, or breast-sparing surgery.           Even if the doctor removes all of the cancer that can be seen at the time of surgery, the patient may be given radiation therapy or chemotherapy after surgery to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left. For pregnant women with early-stage breast cancer, radiation therapy and hormone therapy are given after the baby is born. Treatment given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    External radiation therapy is not given to pregnant women with early stage (stage I or II) breast cancer because it can harm the unborn baby. For women with late stage (stage III or IV) breast cancer, radiation therapy is not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy and is delayed until after the baby is born, if possible.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Chemotherapy is usually not given during the first 3 months of pregnancy. Chemotherapy given after this time does not usually harm the unborn baby but may cause early labor and low birth weight.    See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    Ending the pregnancy does not seem to improve the mothers chance of survival.
                    Because ending the pregnancy is not likely to improve the mothers chance of survival, it is not usually a treatment option.
                
                
                    Treatment for breast cancer may cause side effects.

Radiation therapy and chemotherapy should not be given during the first 3 months of pregnancy.","The reasons for delaying radiation therapy in pregnant women with breast cancer primarily relate to the potential risks to the unborn baby and the stage of the disease. 

1. **Potential Harm to the Unborn Baby**: Radiation therapy, especially external radiation, poses risks to the developing fetus. It may harm the unborn baby, which is a critical consideration when planning treatment during pregnancy.

2. **Stage of the Disease**: For pregnant women with early-stage breast cancer (stage I or II), it is advised to delay radiation therapy until after the baby is born because of these risks. For women with late-stage breast cancer (stage III or IV), radiation therapy is typically not administered during the first three months of pregnancy and is also delayed until after delivery if possible.

                    After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Breast cancer in men is staged the same as it is in women. The spread of cancer from the breast to lymph nodes and other parts of the body appears to be similar in men and women.   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for male breast cancer:
                    This section describes the stages of breast cancer. The breast cancer stage is based on the results of testing that is done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and other tests.     Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    There are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ:            -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive.     -  Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only.      -  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast. This condition has not been seen in men.               Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB.            - In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has not spread outside the breast.     - In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either:                  - no tumor is found in the breast; or       - the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.                         Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA                   - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                - In stage IIB, the tumor is:                  - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or        - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                          Stage IIIA    In stage IIIA:            - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy).               Stage IIIB    In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer. Also, cancer may have spread to :            - up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or     - the lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.       Stage IIIC    In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall. Also, cancer has spread to:             - 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or     -  lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or     - axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.    For treatment, stage IIIC breast cancer is divided into operable and inoperable stage IIIC.        Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.","The staging process for male breast cancer is similar to that of female breast cancer in that both rely on tests to determine if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. The stages are defined in a similar manner for both genders, including categories from Stage 0 to Stage IV. The staging criteria consider factors such as tumor size, lymph node involvement, and the presence of metastasis.

Tests used in the staging process, like sentinel lymph node biopsy, chest X-rays, CT scans, bone scans, and PET scans, are applicable to both male and female breast cancer. The spread of cancer through tissues, the lymph system, and the blood is analogous in both men and women. Ultimately, the information gathered from the staging process is critical for planning appropriate treatment for both male and female breast cancer patients.",632,Can you explain how the staging process for male breast cancer is similar to that of female breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively explains how the staging process for male breast cancer is similar to that of female breast cancer, covering key aspects such as the reliance on tests, the defined stages, and the factors considered in staging.

                    Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the lymph system.
                    Childhood Hodgkin lymphoma is a type of cancer that develops in the lymph system, which is part of the body's immune system. The immune system protects the body from foreign substances, infection, and diseases. The lymph system is made up of the following:         -  Lymph: Colorless, watery fluid that carries white blood cells called lymphocytes through the lymph system. Lymphocytes protect the body against infections and the growth of tumors.    -  Lymph vessels: A network of thin tubes that collect lymph from different parts of the body and return it to the bloodstream.     -  Lymph nodes: Small, bean-shaped structures that filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Lymph nodes are located along the network of lymph vessels found throughout the body. Clusters of lymph nodes are found in the neck, underarm, abdomen, pelvis, and groin.    -  Spleen: An organ that makes lymphocytes, filters the blood, stores blood cells, and destroys old blood cells. The spleen is on the left side of the abdomen near the stomach.    -  Thymus: An organ in which lymphocytes grow and multiply. The thymus is in the chest behind the breastbone.    -  Tonsils: Two small masses of lymph tissue at the back of the throat. The tonsils make lymphocytes.    -  Bone marrow: The soft, spongy tissue in the center of large bones. Bone marrow makes white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets.         Lymph tissue is also found in other parts of the body such as the stomach, thyroid gland, brain, and skin.   There are two general types of lymphoma: Hodgkin lymphoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)     Hodgkin lymphoma often occurs in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age. The treatment for children and adolescents is different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment for more information.)
                
                
                    There are two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    The two types of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma are:         -  Classical Hodgkin lymphoma.    -  Nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma.        Classical Hodgkin lymphoma is divided into four subtypes, based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope:         - Lymphocyte-rich classical Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Nodular sclerosis Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Mixed cellularity Hodgkin lymphoma.     - Lymphocyte-depleted Hodgkin lymphoma.","The prognosis of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma can vary based on several risk factors, which influence both the chance of recovery and the treatment options available. Here are the key factors that determine prognosis and their impact on treatment:

1. **Stage of Cancer**: The stage indicates how far the cancer has spread. Advanced stages (e.g., III and IV) generally have a poorer prognosis and may require more aggressive treatment.

2. **Size of the Tumor**: Larger tumors can suggest more aggressive disease and may influence treatment strategies, often necessitating higher doses of chemotherapy or radiation.

3. **B Symptoms at Diagnosis**: The presence of symptoms such as fever, weight loss, and night sweats (known as B symptoms) can indicate a more advanced disease which could impact treatment intensity and prognosis.

4. **Type of Hodgkin Lymphoma**: The histological subtype (e.g., classical Hodgkin lymphoma vs. nodular lymphocyte-predominant Hodgkin lymphoma) has a role in determining prognosis and tailoring treatment regimens.

5. **Features of Cancer Cells**: Certain characteristics observed in cancer cells during biopsy can indicate the aggressiveness of the disease and guide treatment decisions.

6. **Blood Cell Counts**: Abnormal levels of white blood cells or red blood cells at diagnosis can influence the approach to treatment and the overall prognosis.

7. **Response to Initial Treatment**: How well the tumor responds to the initial chemotherapy is a strong indicator of future prognosis and may result in the need for adjusted treatment plans.

8. **Recurrence**: If the lymphoma has recurred after initial treatment, the prognosis may be less favorable, and more intensive treatment options such as high-dose chemotherapy and stem cell transplant might be necessary.

Overall, prognosis and treatment options are interlinked with these risk factors, and treatment plans are typically personalized to optimize outcomes based on an individual child’s situation. Most children with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured, especially when treatment is initiated promptly.",362,"How does the prognosis of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma vary based on certain risk factors, and what impact do these factors have on treatment options?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the original topic by discussing the prognosis of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma and how various risk factors influence treatment options.

                    Parathyroid cancer is a rare disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of a parathyroid gland.
                    The parathyroid glands are four pea-sized organs found in the neck near the thyroid gland. The parathyroid glands make parathyroid hormone (PTH or parathormone). PTH helps the body use and store calcium to keep the calcium in the blood at normal levels.     A parathyroid gland may become overactive and make too much PTH, a condition called hyperparathyroidism. Hyperparathyroidism can occur when a benign tumor (noncancer), called an adenoma, forms on one of the parathyroid glands, and causes it to grow and become overactive. Sometimes hyperparathyroidism can be caused by parathyroid cancer, but this is very rare.   The extra PTH causes:          - The calcium stored in the bones to move into the blood.    - The intestines to absorb more calcium from the food we eat.        This condition is called hypercalcemia (too much calcium in the blood).   The hypercalcemia caused by hyperparathyroidism is more serious and life-threatening than parathyroid cancer itself and treating hypercalcemia is as important as treating the cancer.","Hyperparathyroidism is a condition where one or more of the parathyroid glands become overactive, resulting in the excessive production of parathyroid hormone (PTH). This overproduction can lead to elevated calcium levels in the blood, a condition known as hypercalcemia. Hypercalcemia can cause a variety of symptoms, including weakness, fatigue, nausea, and increased thirst and urination, among others.

The relationship between hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid cancer is that hyperparathyroidism can occur due to parathyroid cancer, although this is very rare. In most cases, hyperparathyroidism is caused by benign tumors called adenomas on the parathyroid glands. When parathyroid cancer does occur, it can similarly cause an overproduction of PTH, leading to increased calcium levels in the blood.

Managing hyperparathyroidism and the resulting hypercalcemia is crucial, as hypercalcemia from this condition can be more serious and life-threatening than parathyroid cancer itself. Treatment efforts focus on controlling the calcium levels, which may involve surgery to remove the overactive gland or other supportive measures.",127,"Can you explain the relationship between hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid cancer, and how does hyperparathyroidism impact calcium levels in the body?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the relationship between hyperparathyroidism and parathyroid cancer, explains how hyperparathyroidism impacts calcium levels in the body, and includes symptoms associated with elevated calcium levels.

                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors form from germ cells in parts of the body other than the brain.
                    A germ cell is a type of cell that forms as a fetus (unborn baby) develops. These cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries. Sometimes while the fetus is forming, germ cells travel to parts of the body where they should not be and grow into a germ cell tumor. The tumor may form before or after birth.   This summary is about germ cell tumors that form in parts of the body that are extracranial (outside the brain). Extracranial germ cell tumors usually form in the following areas of the body:          - Testicles.    - Ovaries.    -  Sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine).    - Retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).    -  Mediastinum (area between the lungs).               Extracranial germ cell tumors are most common in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age.   See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for information on intracranial (inside the brain) germ cell tumors.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign or malignant.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer).
                
                
                    There are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped into mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and malignant germ cell tumors:      Mature Teratomas     Mature teratomas are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. Mature teratomas are benign tumors and not likely to become cancer. They usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or in the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. The cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope. Some mature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Immature Teratomas     Immature teratomas also usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. Immature teratomas have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. Immature teratomas may be cancer. They often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. Some immature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Malignant Germ Cell Tumors     Malignant germ cell tumors are cancer. There are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors:            - Germinomas: Tumors that make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). There are three types of germinomas.                  -  Dysgerminomas form in the ovary in girls.       -  Seminomas form in the testicle in boys.       - Germinomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle.                - Nongerminomas: There are four types of nongerminomas.                  - Yolk sac tumors make a hormone called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Choriocarcinomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Embryonal carcinomas may make a hormone called -hCG and/or a hormone called AFP. They can form in the testicle or other parts of the body, but not in the ovary.       - Mixed germ cell tumors are made up of both malignant germ cell tumor and teratoma. They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped as gonadal or extragonadal.
                    Malignant extracranial germ cell tumors are gonadal or extragonadal.     Gonadal Germ Cell Tumors    Gonadal germ cell tumors form in the testicles in boys or ovaries in girls.          Testicular Germ Cell Tumors        Testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two main types, seminoma and nonseminoma.               - Seminomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).      - Nonseminomas are usually large and cause signs or symptoms. They tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas.              Testicular germ cell tumors usually occur before the age of 4 years or in adolescents and young adults. Testicular germ cell tumors in adolescents and young adults are different from those that form in early childhood.     Boys older than 14 years with testicular germ cell tumors are treated in pediatric cancer centers, but the treatment is much like the treatment used in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Testicular Cancer Treatment for more information.)             Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors        Ovarian germ cell tumors are more common in adolescent girls and young women. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign teratomas. Sometimes immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors (cancer) occur. (See the PDQ summary on Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information.)          Extragonadal Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors    Extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form in areas other than the brain, testicles, or ovaries.    Most extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form along the midline of the body. This includes the following:             - Sacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower spine that forms part of the pelvis).     -  Coccyx (the small bone at the bottom of the spine, also called the tailbone).     -  Mediastinum (the area between the lungs).     -  Back of the abdomen.     -  Neck.           In younger children, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. Most of these tumors are teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx.    In older children, adolescents, and young adults, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum.","The main differences between gonadal and extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors in terms of origin and common sites of occurrence are as follows:

- **Origin**: 
  - Gonadal germ cell tumors originate from germ cells in the gonads, specifically the testicles in boys and the ovaries in girls.
  - Extragonadal germ cell tumors arise from developing germ cells that have traveled from the gonads to other parts of the body.

- **Common Sites of Occurrence**:
  - Gonadal germ cell tumors typically occur in the testicles or ovaries.
  - Extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are commonly found in areas along the midline of the body, including the sacrum, coccyx, mediastinum, retroperitoneum, and neck.",103,What are the main differences between gonadal and extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors in terms of origin and common sites of occurrence?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer clearly addresses the main differences between gonadal and extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors in terms of origin and common sites of occurrence, matching the information provided in the original answer.

                    After nonmelanoma skin cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the skin or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the skin or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Lymph node biopsy : For squamous cell carcinoma, the lymph nodes may be removed and checked to see if cancer has spread to them.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if skin cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually skin cancer cells. The disease is metastatic skin cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    Staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer depends on whether the tumor has certain ""high-risk"" features and if the tumor is on the eyelid.
                    Staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is on the eyelid is different from staging for nonmelanoma skin cancer that affects other parts of the body.     The following are high-risk features for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid:         - The tumor is thicker than 2 millimeters.    - The tumor is described as Clark level IV (has spread into the lower layer of the dermis) or Clark level V (has spread into the layer of fat below the skin).    - The tumor has grown and spread along nerve pathways.    - The tumor began on an ear or on a lip that has hair on it.    - The tumor has cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer that is not on the eyelid:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)     In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the squamous cell or basal cell layer of the epidermis (topmost layer of the skin). These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed. The tumor is not larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point and may have one high-risk feature.       Stage II     In stage II, the tumor is either:            - larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point; or     - any size and has two or more high-risk features.              Stage III    In stage III:            - The tumor has spread to the jaw, eye socket, or side of the skull. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor. The lymph node is not larger than 3 centimeters.              or              - Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor. The lymph node is not larger than 3 centimeters and one of the following is true:                  - the tumor is not larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point and may have one high-risk feature; or       - the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters at its widest point; or       - the tumor is any size and has two or more high-risk features.                          Stage IV    In stage IV, one of the following is true:            - The tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw, eye socket, or side of the skull. Cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the body as the tumor and the affected node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one or both sides of the body and the affected nodes are not larger than 6 centimeters; or     - The tumor is any size and may have spread to the jaw, eye socket, skull, spine, or ribs. Cancer has spread to one lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters; or      - The tumor is any size and has spread to the base of the skull, spine, or ribs. Cancer may have spread to the lymph nodes; or     - Cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lung.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for nonmelanoma skin cancer on the eyelid:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the epidermis (topmost layer of the skin). These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I      Stage I is divided into stages IA, IB, and IC.            -  Stage IA: The tumor is 5 millimeters or smaller and has not spread to the connective tissue of the eyelid or to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are.      -  Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 5 millimeters but not larger than 10 millimeters or has spread to the connective tissue of the eyelid, or to the edge of the eyelid where the lashes are.     -  Stage IC: The tumor is larger than 10 millimeters but not larger than 20 millimeters or has spread through the full thickness of the eyelid.              Stage II    In stage II, one of the following is true:            - The tumor is larger than 20 millimeters.     - The tumor has spread to nearby parts of the eye or eye socket.     - The tumor has spread to spaces around the nerves in the eyelid.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.            -  Stage IIIA: To remove all of the tumor, the whole eye and part of the optic nerve must be removed. The bone, muscles, fat, and connective tissue around the eye may also be removed.     -  Stage IIIB: The tumor may be anywhere in or near the eye and has spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  Stage IIIC: The tumor has spread to structures around the eye or in the face, or to the brain, and cannot be removed in surgery.              Stage IV    The tumor has spread to distant parts of the body.
                
                
                    Treatment is based on the type of nonmelanoma skin cancer or other skin condition diagnosed:
                    Basal cell carcinoma      Basal cell carcinoma is the most common type of skin cancer. It usually occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, most often the nose. Often this cancer appears as a raised bump that looks smooth and pearly. Another type looks like a scar and is flat and firm and may be white, yellow, or waxy. Basal cell carcinoma may spread to tissues around the cancer, but it usually does not spread to other parts of the body.       Squamous cell carcinoma      Squamous cell carcinoma occurs on areas of the skin that have been in the sun, such as the ears, lower lip, and the back of the hands. Squamous cell carcinoma may also appear on areas of the skin that have been burned or exposed to chemicals or radiation. Often this cancer appears as a firm red bump. The tumor may feel scaly, bleed, or form a crust. Squamous cell tumors may spread to nearby lymph nodes. Squamous cell carcinoma that has not spread can usually be cured.       Actinic keratosis     Actinic keratosis is a skin condition that is not cancer, but sometimes changes into squamous cell carcinoma. It usually occurs in areas that have been exposed to the sun, such as the face, the back of the hands, and the lower lip. It looks like rough, red, pink, or brown scaly patches on the skin that may be flat or raised, or the lower lip cracks and peels and is not helped by lip balm or petroleum jelly.","The staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer differs based on the location of the tumor. Specifically, the context notes that staging is influenced by whether the tumor is located on the eyelid or elsewhere on the body. 

For tumors that are not on the eyelid, the staging progresses as follows:
- **Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)**: Abnormal cells are found in the top layer of skin.
- **Stage I**: The tumor is no larger than 2 centimeters.
- **Stage II**: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters or has two or more high-risk features.
- **Stage III**: The tumor has spread to nearby structures or lymph nodes on the same side as the tumor.
- **Stage IV**: The tumor has spread to distant parts of the body or to multiple lymph nodes.

In contrast, for tumors located on the eyelid, the staging includes:
- **Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)**: Abnormal cells are found in the epidermis.
- **Stage I**: Divided into stages IA (tumor ≤ 5 mm without spreading), IB (tumor > 5 mm but ≤ 10 mm or has spread to connective tissue), and IC (tumor > 10 mm but ≤ 20 mm).
- **Stage II**: The tumor is larger than 20 mm or has spread to nearby parts of the eye or eyelid area.
- **Stage III**: Divided into IIIA (involves removal of the eye or surrounding tissues), IIIB (spread to nearby lymph nodes), and IIIC (spread to adjacent structures or brain).
- **Stage IV**: The tumor has metastasized to distant areas of the body.

The differentiation in staging emphasizes the higher complexity and potential severity of nonmelanoma skin cancers located on the eyelid compared to those found on other body parts.",116,Can you explain how the staging of nonmelanoma skin cancer varies between tumors located on the eyelid versus those on other parts of the body?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and elaborates on the staging differences between nonmelanoma skin cancer located on the eyelid and other parts of the body.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with urethral cancer.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with urethral cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to remove the cancer is the most common treatment for cancer of the urethra. One of the following types of surgery may be done:            -  Open excision: Removal of the cancer by surgery.     -  Transurethral resection (TUR): Surgery to remove the cancer using a special tool inserted into the urethra.     - Electroresection with fulguration: Surgery to remove the cancer by electric current. A lighted tool with a small wire loop on the end is used to remove the cancer or to burn the tumor away with high-energy electricity.      -  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove or destroy tissue.     -  Lymph node dissection: Lymph nodes in the pelvis and groin may be removed.      -  Cystourethrectomy: Surgery to remove the bladder and the urethra.     -  Cystoprostatectomy: Surgery to remove the bladder and the prostate.      -  Anterior exenteration: Surgery to remove the urethra, the bladder, and the vagina. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the vagina.     - Partial penectomy: Surgery to remove the part of the penis surrounding the urethra where cancer has spread. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis.     - Radical penectomy: Surgery to remove the entire penis. Plastic surgery may be done to rebuild the penis.           If the urethra is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for the urine to pass from the body. This is called urinary diversion. If the bladder is removed, the surgeon will make a new way for urine to be stored and passed from the body. The surgeon may use part of the small intestine to make a tube that passes urine through an opening (stoma). This is called an ostomy or urostomy. If a patient has an ostomy, a disposable bag to collect urine is worn under clothing. The surgeon may also use part of the small intestine to make a new storage pouch (continent reservoir) inside the body where the urine can collect. A tube (catheter) is then used to drain the urine through a stoma.     Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat urethral cancer.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer and where the cancer formed in the urethra.       Active surveillance     Active surveillance is following a patient's condition without giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results. It is used to find early signs that the condition is getting worse. In active surveillance, patients are given certain exams and tests, including biopsies, on a regular schedule.
                            
                    
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with small cell lung cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with small cell lung cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery may be used if the cancer is found in one lung and in nearby lymph nodes only. Because this type of lung cancer is usually found in both lungs, surgery alone is not often used. During surgery, the doctor will also remove lymph nodes to find out if they have cancer in them. Sometimes, surgery may be used to remove a sample of lung tissue to find out the exact type of lung cancer.     Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.

When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Small Cell Lung Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat small cell lung cancer, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Radiation therapy to the brain to lessen the risk that cancer will spread to the brain may also be given.       Laser therapy     Laser therapy is a cancer treatment that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) to kill cancer cells.       Endoscopic stent placement     An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument used to look at tissues inside the body. An endoscope has a light and a lens for viewing and may be used to place a stent in a body structure to keep the structure open. An endoscopic stent can be used to open an airway blocked by abnormal tissue.

1. **Surgery**: Typically used if the cancer is localized to one lung and nearby lymph nodes. It's not commonly employed due to the frequent bilateral spread of the disease. Surgery may involve the removal of the lung tumor and lymph nodes to check for cancer presence. Post-surgery, chemotherapy or radiation therapy may be administered for residual cancer cells (adjuvant therapy).

2. **Chemotherapy**: This treatment uses drugs to kill or halt the growth of cancer cells and is vital for managing small cell lung cancer due to its systemic nature.

3. **Radiation therapy**: Employs high-energy radiation to kill or stop the growth of cancer cells. It can be applied externally or internally and is often utilized in conjunction with chemotherapy.

4. **Laser therapy**: This involves using a laser beam to kill cancer cells and is typically applied in more localized cases or to relieve symptoms.

5. **Endoscopic stent placement**: This is used to open airways blocked by abnormal tissue, providing symptomatic relief.

### Use of Surgery in Treatment:
Surgery for small cell lung cancer may be an option when the cancer is found in limited areas, specifically one lung and nearby lymph nodes. It isn’t often the primary approach, given how frequently small cell lung cancer spreads to both lungs. If a surgical intervention occurs, the procedure may aim to eliminate visible tumors and possibly facilitate further treatment (like chemotherapy or radiation therapy) to address remaining cancer cells.",41,"What are the five standard treatment options for patients diagnosed with small cell lung cancer, and how is surgery specifically used in their treatment?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the original question about the five standard treatment options for small cell lung cancer and provides detailed explanations for each treatment type, particularly focusing on how surgery is utilized in the treatment process, which aligns well with the original answer's content."

                    The grade of the tumor is used to plan cancer treatment.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how much cancer there is and if cancer has spread. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    There is no standard staging system for childhood astrocytoma. Treatment is based on the following:          - Whether the tumor is low grade or high grade.    - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent (has come back after treatment).        The grade of the tumor describes how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.   The following grades are used:     Low-grade astrocytomas    Low-grade astrocytomas are slow-growing and rarely spread to other parts of the brain and spinal cord or other parts of the body. There are many types of low-grade astrocytomas. Low-grade astrocytomas can be either:            - Grade I tumors pilocytic astrocytoma, subependymal giant cell tumor, or angiocentric glioma.     - Grade II tumors diffuse astrocytoma, pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma, or choroid glioma of the third ventricle.            Children who have neurofibromatosis type 1 may have more than one low-grade tumor in the brain. Children who have tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of subependymal giant cell astrocytoma.       High-grade astrocytomas     High-grade astrocytomas are fast-growing and often spread within the brain and spinal cord. There are several types of high-grade astrocytomas. High grade astrocytomas can be either:            - Grade III tumors anaplastic astrocytoma or anaplastic pleomorphic xanthoastrocytoma.      - Grade IV tumors glioblastoma or diffuse midline glioma.             Childhood astrocytomas usually do not spread to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    An MRI is done after surgery.
                    An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) is done in the first few days after surgery. This is to find out how much tumor, if any, remains after surgery and to plan further treatment.","The presence of conditions such as neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) and tuberous sclerosis significantly impacts the likelihood of developing low-grade astrocytomas in children. Specifically, children with neurofibromatosis type 1 may have more than one low-grade tumor in the brain, indicating a higher predisposition to these tumors. Additionally, children with tuberous sclerosis have an increased risk of developing subependymal giant cell astrocytoma, a specific type of low-grade astrocytoma.",283,How does the presence of conditions like neurofibromatosis type 1 or tuberous sclerosis impact the likelihood of developing low-grade astrocytomas in children?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the impact of neurofibromatosis type 1 and tuberous sclerosis on the likelihood of developing low-grade astrocytomas in children. It accurately reflects the information presented in the original answer, including specifics about the increased risk for children with these conditions and how they relate to low-grade tumors."
"Tests that examine the brain and spinal cord are used to detect (find) childhood brain and spinal cord tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers.
                         Most childhood brain tumors are diagnosed and removed in surgery. If doctors think there might be a brain tumor, a biopsy may be done to remove a sample of tissue. For tumors in the brain, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The pathologist checks the cancer cells to find out the type and grade of brain tumor. The grade of the tumor is based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.    The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.         
                    					Some childhood brain and spinal cord tumors are diagnosed by imaging tests. Sometimes a biopsy or surgery cannot be done safely because of where the tumor formed in the brain or spinal cord. These tumors are diagnosed based on the results of imaging tests and other procedures.","The use of gadolinium enhances the MRI imaging process for detecting brain and spinal cord tumors in children by being injected into a vein, where it collects around the cancer cells. This increases the visibility of the tumors, allowing them to show up brighter in the MRI pictures. This improved contrast helps in accurately identifying and diagnosing the presence of these tumors.",243,In what way does the use of gadolinium enhance the MRI imaging process for detecting brain and spinal cord tumors in children?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains how gadolinium enhances the MRI imaging process by detailing its injection, the collection around cancer cells, and the resulting increased visibility of the tumors.

Use of tobacco products and heavy drinking can affect the risk of developing hypopharyngeal cancer. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors include the following:         - Smoking tobacco.    - Chewing tobacco.    - Heavy alcohol use.    - Eating a diet without enough nutrients.    - Having Plummer-Vinson syndrome.,"Heavy alcohol consumption contributes to the likelihood of developing hypopharyngeal cancer because it is a recognized risk factor for the disease.

                    After anal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the anus or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the anus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen or chest, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. For anal cancer, a CT scan of the pelvis and abdomen may be done.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if anal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually anal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic anal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for anal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the innermost lining of the anus. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.        Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.        Stage IIIA     In stage IIIA, the tumor may be any size and has spread to either:            -  lymph nodes near the rectum; or      - nearby organs, such as the vagina, urethra, and bladder.              Stage IIIB    In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and has spread:            - to nearby organs and to lymph nodes near the rectum; or     - to lymph nodes on one side of the pelvis and/or groin, and may have spread to nearby organs; or     - to lymph nodes near the rectum and in the groin, and/or to lymph nodes on both sides of the pelvis and/or groin, and may have spread to nearby organs.              Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to lymph nodes or nearby organs and has spread to distant parts of the body.","The differences in tumor size and spread between Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III anal cancer are as follows:

- **Stage I**: In Stage I, cancer has formed and the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. There is no spread to lymph nodes.

- **Stage II**: In Stage II, the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters, but no larger than 4 centimeters. Similar to Stage I, there is no spread to lymph nodes.

- **Stage III**: This stage is divided into two categories (IIIA and IIIB):
  - **Stage IIIA**: The tumor may be any size and has spread to either lymph nodes near the rectum or to nearby organs such as the vagina, urethra, or bladder.
  - **Stage IIIB**: The tumor may also be any size but has spread to nearby organs and to lymph nodes near the rectum, or to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis. 

Overall, as the stages progress from I to III, both the size of the tumor increases and the extent of its spread to nearby lymph nodes and organs escalates.",603,"What are the differences in tumor size and spread between Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III anal cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the differences in tumor size and spread between Stage I, Stage II, and Stage III anal cancer, aligning closely with the information provided in the original answer.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the disease.    - The location and size of the tumor.    - The grade of the tumor.    - The patient's age, gender, and general health, including whether the patient is anemic.         Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the disease.    - The location and size of the tumor.    - Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.    - Whether the cancer has come back (recurred).        Smoking tobacco and drinking alcohol decrease the effectiveness of treatment for laryngeal cancer. Patients with laryngeal cancer who continue to smoke and drink are less likely to be cured and more likely to develop a second tumor. After treatment for laryngeal cancer, frequent and careful follow-up is important.","Lifestyle choices, specifically smoking and alcohol consumption, significantly decrease the effectiveness of treatment for laryngeal cancer.

                    After retinoblastoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the eye or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the eye or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines whether retinoblastoma is only in the eye (intraocular) or has spread outside the eye (extraocular). It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner that also takes a picture of the body. Areas of bone with cancer show up brighter in the picture because they take up more radioactive material than normal bone cells do.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow under a microscope to look for signs of cancer. A bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done if the doctor thinks the cancer has spread outside of the eye.    -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that the cancer has spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.
                
                
                    The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) may be used for staging retinoblastoma.
                    There are several staging systems for retinoblastoma. The IRSS stages are based on how much cancer remains after surgery to remove the tumor and whether the cancer has spread.      Stage 0     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has not been removed and the tumor was treated without surgery.        Stage I    The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and no cancer cells remain.        Stage II     The tumor is in the eye only. The eye has been removed and there are cancer cells left that can be seen only with a microscope.        Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIa and IIIb:            - In stage IIIa, cancer has spread from the eye to tissues around the eye socket.     - In stage IIIb, cancer has spread from the eye to lymph nodes near the ear or in the neck.               Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stages IVa and IVb:            - In stage IVa, cancer has spread to the blood but not to the brain or spinal cord. One or more tumors may have spread to other parts of the body such as the bone or liver.     - In stage IVb, cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord. It also may have spread to other parts of the body.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if retinoblastoma spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually retinoblastoma cells. The disease is metastatic retinoblastoma, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    Treatment for retinoblastoma depends on whether it is intraocular (within the eye) or extraocular (outside the eye).
                    Intraocular retinoblastoma     In intraocular retinoblastoma, cancer is found in one or both eyes and may be in the retina only or may also be in other parts of the eye such as the choroid, ciliary body, or part of the optic nerve. Cancer has not spread to tissues around the outside of the eye or to other parts of the body.        Extraocular retinoblastoma (metastatic)    In extraocular retinoblastoma, cancer has spread beyond the eye. It may be found in tissues around the eye (orbital retinoblastoma) or it may have spread to the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body such as the liver, bones, bone marrow, or lymph nodes.","The International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) indicates that the progression of retinoblastoma can be categorized into several stages from Stage 0 to Stage IV:

- **Stage 0**: The tumor is confined to the eye only, treated without surgery, and the eye has not been removed.
- **Stage I**: The tumor is still in the eye, but the eye has been removed, and there are no remaining cancer cells.
- **Stage II**: The tumor remains in the eye, the eye has been removed, and detectable cancer cells are left that can only be seen under a microscope.
- **Stage III**: This stage is further divided into IIIa and IIIb, where cancer has spread beyond the eye. In IIIa, it has spread to the tissues surrounding the eye socket; in IIIb, it has spread to nearby lymph nodes.
- **Stage IV**: This stage is further divided into IVa and IVb. In IVa, the cancer has spread to the blood but not to the brain or spinal cord, potentially affecting other areas like the bone or liver. In IVb, the cancer has spread to the brain or spinal cord and may also extend to other body parts.

Overall, the progression from Stage 0 to Stage IV reflects increasing severity and spread of the disease, from being localized to the eye to metastasis beyond the eye and into vitally important structures like the brain and blood.",651,What does the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS) indicate about the progression of the disease from Stage 0 to Stage IV?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and elaborates on the staging of retinoblastoma as established by the International Retinoblastoma Staging System (IRSS).

                    The following stages are used for thymoma:
                    Stage I    In stage I, cancer is found only within the thymus. All cancer cells are inside the capsule (sac) that surrounds the thymus.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread through the capsule and into the fat around the thymus or into the lining of the chest cavity.       Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread to nearby organs in the chest, including the lung, the sac around the heart, or large blood vessels that carry blood to the heart.       Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB, depending on where the cancer has spread.            - In stage IVA, cancer has spread widely around the lungs and heart.     - In stage IVB, cancer has spread to the blood or lymph system.
                
                
                    Thymic carcinomas have usually spread to other parts of the body when diagnosed.
                    The staging system used for thymomas is sometimes used for thymic carcinomas.","The staging of thymic carcinoma generally shows that it has usually spread to other parts of the body when diagnosed, making it typically more advanced than thymoma. In contrast, thymoma's staging includes four specific stages, indicating that it can often be confined to the thymus and can be treated with different approaches depending on whether it has spread beyond its initial site.

The importance of staging for both thymic carcinoma and thymoma is crucial for treatment planning. Knowing the stage of the disease helps determine the appropriate treatment options and strategies. For thymoma, treatment may include surgery followed by radiation or chemotherapy depending on the stage, whereas for thymic carcinoma, which tends to be more extensive at diagnosis, treatment may involve more aggressive chemotherapy and radiation if surgery is not feasible or if the disease has spread significantly. This distinction directly affects prognosis and the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes.",595,"How does the staging of thymic carcinoma compare to that of thymoma, and why is this important for treatment planning?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively compares the staging of thymic carcinoma to that of thymoma and emphasizes the importance of staging for treatment planning.

This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.       -  PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.             -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. A fine-needle biopsy is usually done to remove a sample of tissue using a thin needle. The following procedures may be used to remove samples of cells or tissue:               -  Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth or nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The nose, throat, back of the tongue, esophagus, stomach, larynx, windpipe, and large airways will be checked. The type of endoscopy is named for the part of the body that is being examined. For example, pharyngoscopy is an exam to check the pharynx.       -  Laryngoscopy : A procedure in which the doctor checks the larynx with a mirror or with a laryngoscope. A laryngoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.          If cancer is found, the following test may be done to study the cancer cells:               -  HPV test (human papillomavirus test): A laboratory test used to check the sample of tissue for certain types of HPV infection. This test is done because oropharyngeal cancer can be caused by HPV.","During a physical examination for diagnosing oropharyngeal cancer, a doctor might look for the following specific symptoms or signs:

1. **A lump in the neck**: This could indicate swollen lymph nodes due to cancer.
2. **Sore throat**: Persistent sore throat that does not go away could be a sign of oropharyngeal cancer.
3. **Trouble swallowing**: Difficulty swallowing may suggest an obstruction or growth in the oropharynx.
4. **Trouble opening the mouth fully**: Limited mouth opening may be noted during the exam.
5. **Trouble moving the tongue**: Difficulty in tongue mobility may indicate involvement of underlying structures.
6. **Unexplained weight loss**: Significant weight loss without known reasons might be a concern.
7. **Ear pain**: Referred pain to the ear can arise from throat issues.
8. **A lump in the back of the mouth or throat**: Presence of lumps in these areas could indicate tumor growth.
9. **A white patch on the tongue or lining of the mouth**: Persistent lesions like leukoplakia that do not resolve could point towards a malignancy.
10. **Coughing up blood**: Hemoptysis may be a more advanced sign of cancer. 

These findings may require further tests for confirmation, as they can also be caused by other conditions.",330,What specific symptoms or signs might a doctor look for during the physical examination when diagnosing oropharyngeal cancer?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer focuses on specific symptoms that a doctor might look for during a physical examination of a patient suspected of having oropharyngeal cancer, which is related to the original answer.

"Signs of a pituitary tumor include problems with vision and certain physical changes. Signs and symptoms can be caused by the growth of the tumor and/or by hormones the tumor makes or by other conditions. Some tumors may not cause signs or symptoms. Check with your doctor if you have any of these problems.     Signs and symptoms of a non-functioning pituitary tumor    Sometimes, a pituitary tumor may press on or damage parts of the pituitary gland, causing it to stop making one or more hormones. Too little of a certain hormone will affect the work of the gland or organ that the hormone controls. The following signs and symptoms may occur:         - Headache.    - Some loss of vision.    - Loss of body hair.    - In women, less frequent or no menstrual periods or no milk from the breasts.     - In men, loss of facial hair, growth of breast tissue, and impotence.    - In women and men, lower sex drive.    -  In children, slowed growth and sexual development.        Most of the tumors that make LH and FSH do not make enough extra hormone to cause signs and symptoms. These tumors are considered to be non-functioning tumors.    Signs and symptoms of a functioning pituitary tumor    When a functioning pituitary tumor makes extra hormones, the signs and symptoms will depend on the type of hormone being made.    Too much prolactin may cause:          - Headache.    - Some loss of vision.    - Less frequent or no menstrual periods or menstrual periods with a very light flow.     - Trouble becoming pregnant or an inability to become pregnant.    - Impotence in men.    - Lower sex drive.    - Flow of breast milk in a woman who is not pregnant or breast-feeding.         Too much ACTH may cause:          - Headache.    - Some loss of vision.    - Weight gain in the face, neck, and trunk of the body, and thin arms and legs.     - A lump of fat on the back of the neck.    - Thin skin that may have purple or pink stretch marks on the chest or abdomen.    - Easy bruising.    - Growth of fine hair on the face, upper back, or arms.    - Bones that break easily.    -  Anxiety, irritability, and depression.         Too much growth hormone may cause:          - Headache.    - Some loss of vision.    - In adults, acromegaly (growth of the bones in the face, hands, and feet). In children, the whole body may grow much taller and larger than normal.    - Tingling or numbness in the hands and fingers.    - Snoring or pauses in breathing during sleep.    -  Joint pain.    - Sweating more than usual.    - Dysmorphophobia (extreme dislike of or concern about one or more parts of the body).         Too much thyroid-stimulating hormone may cause:          - Irregular heartbeat.    - Shakiness.    - Weight loss.     - Trouble sleeping.    - Frequent bowel movements.    - Sweating.         Other general signs and symptoms of pituitary tumors:          -  Nausea and vomiting.    -  Confusion.    - Dizziness.    -  Seizures.    - Runny or ""drippy"" nose (cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord leaks into the nose).","A patient with a non-functioning pituitary tumor pressing on the gland may experience specific vision problems, including some loss of vision.

                    There are different types of treatment for children with acute myeloid leukemia (AML), chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML), juvenile myelomonocytic leukemia (JMML), or myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS).
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with AML, CML, JMML, or MDS. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.    Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Treatment is planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood leukemia and other diseases of the blood.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other healthcare providers who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Hematologist.    -  Medical oncologist.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Neuropathologist.    -  Neuroradiologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Regular follow-up exams are very important. Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important that parents of children who are treated for AML or other blood diseases talk with their doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on their child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    The treatment of childhood AML usually has two phases.
                    The treatment of childhood AML is done in phases:         -  Induction therapy: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission.    -  Consolidation /intensification therapy: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of therapy is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could begin to regrow and cause a relapse.        Treatment called central nervous system (CNS) sanctuary therapy may be given during the induction phase of therapy. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS (brain and spinal cord), the cells are able to find sanctuary (hide) in the CNS. Intrathecal chemotherapy is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. It is given to kill the leukemia cells and lessen the chance the leukemia will recur (come back). CNS sanctuary therapy is also called CNS prophylaxis.
                
                
                    Seven types of standard treatment are used for childhood AML, childhood CML, JMML, or MDS.
                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated.    In AML, the leukemia cells may spread to the brain and/or spinal cord. Chemotherapy given by mouth or vein to treat AML may not cross the blood-brain barrier to get into the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, chemotherapy is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill leukemia cells that may have spread there (intrathecal chemotherapy).       See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated. In childhood AML, external radiation therapy may be used to treat a chloroma that does not respond to chemotherapy.       Stem cell transplant     Stem cell transplant is a way of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells that are abnormal or destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Types of targeted therapy include the following:            -   Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy: Tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) therapy blocks signals needed for tumors to grow. TKIs block the enzyme (tyrosine kinase) that causes stem cells to become more white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts) than the body needs. TKIs may be used with other anticancer drugs as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after the initial treatment, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).                   -  Imatinib is a type of TKI that is approved to treat childhood CML.        -  Sorafenib, dasatinib, and nilotinib are being studied in the treatment of childhood leukemia.                -   Monoclonal antibody therapy: Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.                   -  Gemtuzumab is a type of monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of a subtype of AML called acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL). Gemtuzumab is not available in the United States unless special approval is given. Monoclonal antibodies may be used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy.                -   Proteasome inhibitor therapy: Proteasome inhibitors break down proteins in cancer cells and kill them.                   -  Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat childhood APL.                      See Drugs Approved for Leukemia for more information.       Other drug therapy     Lenalidomide may be used to lessen the need for transfusions in patients who have myelodysplastic syndromes caused by a specific chromosome change.     Arsenic trioxide and all-trans retinoic acid (ATRA) are anticancer drugs that kill leukemia cells, stop the leukemia cells from dividing, or help the leukemia cells mature into white blood cells. These drugs are used in the treatment of acute promyelocytic leukemia.    See Drugs Approved for Acute Myeloid Leukemia for more information.       Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. It is sometimes used to treat MDS or TMD.       Supportive care     Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care may include the following:            -  Transfusion therapy: A way of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment. The blood may be donated from another person or it may have been taken from the patient earlier and stored until needed.     -  Drug therapy, such as antibiotics or antifungal agents.     -  Leukapheresis: A procedure in which a special machine is used to remove white blood cells from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the white blood cells are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patient's bloodstream.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Natural killer (NK) cells are a type of biologic therapy. NK cells are white blood cells that can kill tumor cells. These may be taken from a donor and given to the patient by infusion to help kill leukemia cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

2. **Consolidation/Intensification Therapy**: 
   - **Goal**: This phase begins after the leukemia is in remission. Its aim is to eliminate any remaining leukemia cells that may not be active but could potentially regrow and cause a relapse. 

Additionally, treatments such as central nervous system sanctuary therapy may be administered during the induction phase to target any leukemia cells in the central nervous system.",517,"What are the two phases of treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia, and what are their specific goals?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately and comprehensively summarizes the two phases of treatment for childhood acute myeloid leukemia (AML) as described in the original answer.

"Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.
	                    	Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Anything that decreases your chance of getting a disease is called a protective factor.   For information about risk factors and protective factors for ovarian cancer, see the Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention summary.   Talk to your doctor about your risk of ovarian cancer.
	                	
                		
		                    Screening tests have risks.
		                    Decisions about screening tests can be difficult. Not all screening tests are helpful and most have risks. Before having any screening test, you may want to talk about the test with your doctor. It is important to know the risks of the test and whether it has been proven to reduce the risk of dying from cancer.
		                
		                
		                    The risks of ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer screening tests include the following:
		                    Finding ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer may not improve health or help a woman live longer.    Screening may not improve your health or help you live longer if you have advanced ovarian cancer or if it has already spread to other places in your body.        False-negative test results can occur.    Screening test results may appear to be normal even though ovarian cancer is present. A woman who receives a false-negative test result (one that shows there is no cancer when there really is) may delay seeking medical care even if she has symptoms.       False-positive test results can occur.     Screening test results may appear to be abnormal even though no cancer is present. A false-positive test result (one that shows there is cancer when there really isn't) can cause anxiety and is usually followed by more tests (such as a laparoscopy or a laparotomy to see if cancer is present), which also have risks. Problems caused by tests used to diagnose ovarian cancer include infection, blood loss, bowel injury, and heart and blood vessel problems. A false-positive test result can also lead to an unneeded oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries).","The potential downsides of undergoing screening tests for ovarian cancer include:

1. **Limited Benefit**: Finding ovarian cancer may not improve health or increase survival, especially in cases where advanced cancer is present or has already spread.

2. **False-Negative Results**: Screening tests can yield false-negative results, which indicate that no cancer is present when it actually is. This can lead to a delay in seeking necessary medical care despite having symptoms.

3. **False-Positive Results**: There is also the risk of false-positive results, where test results suggest cancer is present when it is not. This can cause significant anxiety and typically leads to further testing (like a laparoscopy or laparotomy), which carries its own risks.

4. **Risks Associated with Diagnostic Procedures**: Follow-up tests and procedures needed to confirm or rule out cancer may result in complications such as infection, blood loss, bowel injury, and heart or blood vessel problems.

5. **Unnecessary Surgical Interventions**: A false-positive result can lead to unnecessary surgical procedures, such as an oophorectomy (removal of one or both ovaries), which carries additional risks and implications for the patient’s health. 

Overall, it is essential for individuals to discuss the potential risks and benefits of ovarian cancer screening with their healthcare provider before proceeding.",239,Can you explain the potential downsides of undergoing screening tests for ovarian cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes and elaborates on the potential downsides of ovarian cancer screening outlined in the original answer.

                    - Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary or lining the fallopian tube or peritoneum.     - Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue and are treated the same way.    - Women who have a family history of ovarian cancer are at an increased risk of ovarian cancer.    - Some ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are caused by inherited gene mutations (changes).    - Women with an increased risk of ovarian cancer may consider surgery to lessen the risk.    - Signs and symptoms of ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer include pain or swelling in the abdomen.    - Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer.    - Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery).
                
                
                    Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissue covering the ovary or lining the fallopian tube or peritoneum.
                    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs work).    The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.   The peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.       Ovarian epithelial cancer is one type of cancer that affects the ovary. See the following PDQ treatment summaries for information about other types of ovarian tumors:         -  Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors     -  Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment (ovarian cancer in children)

1. **Tissue Origins**: All three cancers arise from the same type of tissue. They form in the tissue covering the ovaries, lining the fallopian tubes, or the peritoneum, which is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. This common origin links these cancers closely, as they may also share similar pathways of carcinogenesis.

2. **Treatment Methods**: Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer are treated in a similar manner. The standard treatments include surgery, chemotherapy, and targeted therapy. Surgery is typically performed to remove as much of the tumor as possible, followed by chemotherapy to eliminate any remaining cancer cells. Targeted therapy may also be employed to specifically address cancer cells without significantly harming normal cells.

These parallels in tissue origins and treatment protocols highlight the interconnected nature of these cancers and underscore the importance of a unified approach to their management.",485,"Can you explain the similarities in the tissue origins and treatment methods for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects the key points made in the original answer regarding the tissue origins and treatment methods for ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer.

"Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node.       -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.          A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.","During a physical exam for diagnosing childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, a physician should look for the following specific signs and symptoms:

                    - After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    After childhood soft tissue sarcoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the soft tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging. There is no standard staging system for childhood soft tissue sarcoma.    In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the type of soft tissue sarcoma, whether the tumor can be removed by surgery, and whether cancer has spread to other parts of the body.   The following procedures may be used to find out if cancer has spread:         -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy: A sentinel lymph node biopsy is done to check if cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A small amount of a radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The radioactive substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes. This procedure is used for epithelioid and clear cell sarcoma.     -   PET scan: A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. This procedure is also called positron emission tomography (PET) scan.    -   PET-CT scan: A procedure that combines the pictures from a PET scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are soft tissue sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not lung cancer.","In the context of childhood soft tissue sarcoma, for a tumor to metastasize means that cancer cells from the primary tumor have spread to other parts of the body beyond where they initially formed. This occurs when cancer cells break away from the primary tumor and travel through the lymphatic system or bloodstream to establish new tumors in distant locations.

A metastatic tumor is categorized based on the type of cancer from which it originated. Therefore, if soft tissue sarcoma spreads to another organ, such as the lungs, the cells in that organ would still be identified as soft tissue sarcoma cells. This means the disease is referred to as metastatic soft tissue sarcoma, not as lung cancer, despite the location of the metastatic tumors.",507,"In the context of childhood soft tissue sarcoma, what does it mean for a tumor to metastasize, and how is a metastatic tumor categorized?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the concept of metastasis in the context of childhood soft tissue sarcoma by detailing how cancer cells spread and how a metastatic tumor is categorized.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with chronic lymphocytic leukemia. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. This is also called observation. During this time, problems caused by the disease, such as infection, are treated.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat chronic lymphocytic leukemia.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, or the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for more information.       Surgery      Splenectomy is surgery to remove the spleen.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy, tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and BCL2 inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.      Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances in the body that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    Tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy is a cancer treatment that blocks signals needed for tumors to grow.    BCL2 inhibitor therapy is a cancer treatment that blocks a protein called BCL2. BCL2 inhibitor therapy may kill cancer cells and may make them more sensitive to other anticancer drugs.     See Drugs Approved for Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.        Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.       Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of chronic lymphocytic leukemia.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

The stem cells can be collected from the patient (autologous) or from a donor (allogeneic), frozen, and then infused after the chemotherapy treatment is completed. This method is designed to give a stronger initial attack on the cancer, especially in cases where cancer is more aggressive or has not responded to other treatments.

The expected outcomes for patients undergoing this treatment can vary significantly based on several factors, including the specific type of cancer, the patient's overall health, and how well the cancer responds to treatment. While this approach can potentially lead to remission, it may also come with significant risks and side effects, which need to be carefully managed. Evaluating success can involve monitoring blood cell counts and the responsiveness of the cancer. Therefore, close follow-up and testing are essential parts of the treatment process to gauge effectiveness and detect any recurrence of cancer.",713,"How does chemotherapy with stem cell transplant work, and what are the expected outcomes for patients undergoing this treatment?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a detailed description of how chemotherapy with stem cell transplant works and discusses the treatment's expected outcomes, which aligns well with the information in the original answer.

                    After lung cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lungs or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Some of the tests used to diagnose non-small cell lung cancer are also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)    Other tests and procedures that may be used in the staging process include the following:         -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the brain and abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Radionuclide bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.     -   Pulmonary function test (PFT): A test to see how well the lungs are working. It measures how much air the lungs can hold and how quickly air moves into and out of the lungs. It also measures how much oxygen is used and how much carbon dioxide is given off during breathing. This is also called lung function test.    -   Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography. EUS may be used to guide fine needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung, lymph nodes, or other areas.     -   Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Anterior mediastinotomy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs and tissues between the lungs and between the breastbone and heart for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made next to the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This is also called the Chamberlain procedure.    -  Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.     -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if non-small cell lung cancer spreads to the brain, the cancer cells in the brain are actually lung cancer cells. The disease is metastatic lung cancer, not brain cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for non-small cell lung cancer:
                    Occult (hidden) stage    In the occult (hidden) stage, cancer cannot be seen by imaging or bronchoscopy. Cancer cells are found in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs) or bronchial washing (a sample of cells taken from inside the airways that lead to the lung). Cancer may have spread to other parts of the body.       Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the airways. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB:            -  Stage IA: The tumor is in the lung only and is 3 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IB: Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - The tumor is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters.       - Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       - Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.                          Stage II    Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB. Stage IIA and IIB are each divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and whether there is cancer in the lymph nodes.            -  Stage IIA:  (1) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. Also, one or more of the following is true:                  - The tumor is not larger than 5 centimeters.       -  Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       -  Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.            or  (2) Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.       - Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       - Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.                -  Stage IIB:  (1) Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. Also, one or more of the following is true:                  - The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters but not larger than 7 centimeters.       - Cancer has spread to the main bronchus and is at least 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus.       -  Cancer has spread to the innermost layer of the membrane that covers the lung.       - Part of the lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung) in the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.             or (2) Cancer has not spread to lymph nodes and one or more of the following is true:                  - The tumor is larger than 7 centimeters.       - Cancer has spread to the main bronchus (and is less than 2 centimeters below where the trachea joins the bronchus), the chest wall, the diaphragm, or the nerve that controls the diaphragm.        - Cancer has spread to the membrane around the heart or lining the chest wall.       - The whole lung has collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).       - There are one or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the lung.                         Stage IIIA     Stage IIIA is divided into three sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer (if any).     (1) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are near the sternum (chest bone) or where the bronchus enters the lung. Also:            - The tumor may be any size.     - Part of the lung (where the trachea joins the bronchus) or the whole lung may have collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).     - There may be one or more separate tumors in the same lobe of the lung.     - Cancer may have spread to any of the following:                  - Main bronchus, but not the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.       -  Chest wall.       -  Diaphragm and the nerve that controls it.       -  Membrane around the lung or lining the chest wall.       - Membrane around the heart.                        or       (2) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor. The lymph nodes with cancer are within the lung or near the bronchus. Also:            - The tumor may be any size.     - The whole lung may have collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).     - There may be one or more separate tumors in any of the lobes of the lung with cancer.     - Cancer may have spread to any of the following:                  - Main bronchus, but not the area where the trachea joins the bronchus.       - Chest wall.       - Diaphragm and the nerve that controls it.       - Membrane around the lung or lining the chest wall.       - Heart or the membrane around it.       - Major blood vessels that lead to or from the heart.        - Trachea.       -  Esophagus.        - Nerve that controls the larynx (voice box).       -  Sternum (chest bone) or backbone.       -  Carina (where the trachea joins the bronchi).                        or       (3) Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes and the tumor may be any size. Cancer has spread to any of the following:            - Heart.      - Major blood vessels that lead to or from the heart.      - Trachea.      - Esophagus.      - Nerve that controls the larynx (voice box).     - Sternum (chest bone) or backbone.      - Carina (where the trachea joins the bronchi).              Stage IIIB     Stage IIIB is divided into two sections depending on the size of the tumor, where the tumor is found, and which lymph nodes have cancer.     (1) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes above the collarbone or to lymph nodes on the opposite side of the chest as the tumor. Also:            - The tumor may be any size.     - Part of the lung (where the trachea joins the bronchus) or the whole lung may have collapsed or developed pneumonitis (inflammation of the lung).     - There may be one or more separate tumors in any of the lobes of the lung with cancer.     - Cancer may have spread to any of the following:                  - Main bronchus.       -  Chest wall.       -  Diaphragm and the nerve that controls it.       -  Membrane around the lung or lining the chest wall.       - Heart or the membrane around it.       - Major blood vessels that lead to or from the heart.       - Trachea.       -  Esophagus.       - Nerve that controls the larynx (voice box).       -  Sternum (chest bone) or backbone.       -  Carina (where the trachea joins the bronchi).                         or       (2) Cancer has spread to lymph nodes on the same side of the chest as the tumor.

When NSCLC metastasizes, it can spread from the primary tumor via two major pathways: 

1. **Lymph System**: The cancer cells can enter the lymph system and travel through lymph vessels to form metastatic tumors in distant parts of the body. This lymphatic spread usually indicates that NSCLC has invaded the local lymph nodes first, which plays a critical role in the staging of the disease.

2. **Blood**: Alternatively, the cancer can invade blood vessels, allowing cancer cells to disseminate throughout the body and establish secondary tumors in various organs (such as the brain, liver, or bones). 

In contrast, the growth into nearby tissues involves local extension where the tumor infiltrates adjacent structures directly, such as the chest wall, bronchi, or pleura.

The implications for patient prognosis are substantial. Lymphatic and hematogenous spread typically signifies more advanced stages of cancer, which can correlate with a more aggressive disease course and poorer prognosis. Metastasis indicates that the cancer is no longer localized, significantly complicating treatment options and often leading to a worse overall outcome compared to cases where the cancer remains confined to the lungs or nearby tissues. The prognosis for NSCLC heavily relies on the stage at which it is diagnosed, underscoring the importance of early detection and comprehensive staging.",5,"In terms of metastasis, how does the spread of non-small cell lung cancer through the lymph system and blood differ from growth into nearby tissues, and what implications does this have for patient prognosis?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the topic of metastasis and distinguishes between the modes of spread (lymphatic vs. hematogenous) and local growth into nearby tissues. However, it does not directly mention specific stages of non-small cell lung cancer or the detailed processes described in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the blood and bone marrow are used to detect (find) and diagnose myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease such as an enlarged spleen and liver. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Complete blood count (CBC) with differential : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells and platelets.       - The number and type of white blood cells.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.       - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for blast cells, the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of a small piece of bone and bone marrow by inserting a needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views both the bone and bone marrow samples under a microscope to look for abnormal cells.  The following tests may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:               -  Cytogenetic analysis : A test in which cells in a sample of blood or bone marrow are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes. The cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms do not contain the Philadelphia chromosome that is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia.      -  Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of bone marrow. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the cells in the sample to light up under a microscope. This type of test is used to tell the difference between myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms, leukemia, and other conditions.","Cytogenetic analysis and immunocytochemistry are significant tools in distinguishing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms from other blood disorders such as leukemia. 

Cytogenetic analysis involves examining the chromosomes in samples of blood or bone marrow under a microscope to identify specific chromosomal abnormalities. For instance, cancer cells in myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms notably do not contain the Philadelphia chromosome, which is present in chronic myelogenous leukemia. This distinction helps in accurate diagnosis.

Immunocytochemistry uses antibodies to detect particular antigens in bone marrow samples. This test aids in differentiating myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms from other conditions, including various forms of leukemia, based on the presence or absence of specific markers.

Together, these techniques provide crucial information about the genetic and molecular characteristics of blood disorders, thereby guiding appropriate diagnosis and treatment plans.",235,What is the significance of cytogenetic analysis and immunocytochemistry in distinguishing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms from other blood disorders such as leukemia?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the significance of cytogenetic analysis and immunocytochemistry in distinguishing myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms from other disorders like leukemia.

Signs of non-small cell lung cancer include a cough that doesn't go away and shortness of breath. Sometimes lung cancer does not cause any signs or symptoms. It may be found during a chest x-ray done for another condition. Signs and symptoms may be caused by lung cancer or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Chest discomfort or pain.    - A cough that doesnt go away or gets worse over time.     - Trouble breathing.     - Wheezing.     -  Blood in sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).     - Hoarseness.     - Loss of appetite.    - Weight loss for no known reason.     - Feeling very tired.    - Trouble swallowing.    - Swelling in the face and/or veins in the neck.,"Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) may not present noticeable symptoms in some individuals due to the nature of the disease and the way it develops. Often, the cancer grows slowly and may not disturb normal lung function or cause discomfort until it reaches a more advanced stage. In some cases, it might be discovered incidentally during tests conducted for other reasons, such as a chest x-ray for a different medical condition.

Detection of non-small cell lung cancer in asymptomatic individuals typically relies on imaging tests. Chest x-rays or CT scans are commonly employed to examine the lungs for any abnormalities, allowing for the identification of tumors even when no symptoms are present.",2,"Why might non-small cell lung cancer not present any noticeable symptoms in some individuals, and how can it be detected in such cases?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the question of why non-small cell lung cancer may not present noticeable symptoms, explaining the slow growth of the cancer and its potential for detection through imaging tests like chest x-rays.

                    Pituitary tumors are described in several ways.
                    Pituitary tumors are described by their size and grade, whether or not they make extra hormones, and whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.   The following sizes are used:         - Microadenoma: The tumor is smaller than 1 centimeter.    - Macroadenoma: The tumor is 1 centimeter or larger.        Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas.    The grade of a pituitary tumor is based on how far it has grown into the surrounding area of the brain, including the sella (the bone at the base of the skull, where the pituitary gland sits).","The grading of pituitary tumors is based on how far the tumor has grown into the surrounding brain tissue, including the sella, which is the bone at the base of the skull where the pituitary gland is located. The classification reflects the tumor's invasiveness and its potential for malignancy.

                    Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease. See the General Information section for more information.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor.            -  Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs.              Stage III     In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.        Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity. It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes.","Staging is crucial in the treatment planning for pancreatic cancer as it helps determine the extent of cancer spread and informs the selection of appropriate treatment options. By assessing whether the cancer is localized to the pancreas or has spread to surrounding tissues, lymph nodes, or distant organs, healthcare providers can develop a targeted treatment plan. 

For pancreatic cancer, different stages (Stage 0 to Stage IV) guide the recommended treatments. For instance, Stage I and II may involve surgical options followed by chemotherapy or chemoradiation, while Stage III may focus on palliative surgery or chemotherapy and targeted approaches. Stage IV treatment typically involves palliative measures to manage symptoms and improve quality of life since the cancer has spread significantly. Thus, staging not only influences the therapeutic strategy but also the prognosis and overall management of the disease.",676,Can you explain the significance of staging in the treatment planning for pancreatic cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the significance of staging in treatment planning for pancreatic cancer, aligning closely with the information provided in the original answer about the importance of staging, the different stages, and how they influence treatment decisions.

                    - Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.    - Prostate cancer is the most common nonskin cancer among men in the United States.    - Different factors increase or decrease the risk of developing prostate cancer.
                
                
                    Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.
                    The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system located just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of semen.      As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH), and although it is not cancer, surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of benign prostatic hyperplasia or of other problems in the prostate may be similar to symptoms of prostate cancer.      See the following PDQ summaries for more information about prostate cancer:         -   Prostate Cancer Prevention     -  Prostate Cancer Treatment","Some risk factors associated with the development of prostate cancer include:

1. **Age**: Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years; the likelihood of diagnosis increases as men grow older.

2. **Family History**: Men who have a father, brother, or son with prostate cancer have a higher-than-average risk of developing the disease.

3. **Race**: Prostate cancer occurs more frequently in African-American men compared to white men, and they are also more likely to die from it.

4. **Hormones**: The prostate's dependence on male hormones, particularly testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone (DHT), plays a significant role in prostate cancer development.

5. **Dietary Factors**: High intake of vitamin E and folic acid from supplements has been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer, while diets high in dairy foods and calcium may also slightly elevate risk.

These risk factors influence the likelihood of diagnosis, as they can affect both the biological susceptibility to developing prostate cancer and the probability of finding the disease during screenings or when symptoms arise. For instance, older men and those with a family history or specific racial backgrounds are more closely monitored, leading to potentially earlier diagnosis.",53,What are some risk factors associated with the development of prostate cancer and how do they influence the likelihood of diagnosis?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the risk factors associated with prostate cancer, as requested in the generated question.

                    There are different types of treatment for children with brain and spinal cord tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with brain and spinal cord tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with brain or spinal cord tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood brain and spinal cord tumors.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other health care providers who are experts in treating children with brain tumors and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Neurosurgeon.    -  Neurologist.    -  Neuro-oncologist.    -  Neuropathologist.    -  Neuroradiologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Ophthalmologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Nurse specialist.
                
                
                    Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Childhood brain and spinal cord tumors may cause signs or symptoms that continue for months or years. Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. Signs or symptoms caused by treatment may begin during or right after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    These are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).         Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors. See the General Information section of this summary.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood brain and spinal cord tumors.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells there. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.","The specialists typically involved in the treatment planning for children diagnosed with brain and spinal cord tumors include:

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with melanoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery      Surgery to remove the tumor is the primary treatment of all stages of melanoma. A wide local excision is used to remove the melanoma and some of the normal tissue around it. Skin grafting (taking skin from another part of the body to replace the skin that is removed) may be done to cover the wound caused by surgery.     It is important to know whether cancer has spread to the lymph nodes. Lymph node mapping and sentinel lymph node biopsy are done to check for cancer in the sentinel lymph node (the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor) during surgery. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, more lymph nodes will be removed and tissue samples will be checked for signs of cancer. This is called a lymphadenectomy.    Even if the doctor removes all the melanoma that can be seen at the time of surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Chemotherapy given after surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.    Surgery to remove cancer that has spread to the lymph nodes, lung, gastrointestinal (GI) tract, bone, or brain may be done to improve the patients quality of life by controlling symptoms.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).    One type of regional chemotherapy is hyperthermic isolated limb perfusion. With this method, anticancer drugs go directly to the arm or leg the cancer is in. The flow of blood to and from the limb is temporarily stopped with a tourniquet. A warm solution with the anticancer drug is put directly into the blood of the limb. This gives a high dose of drugs to the area where the cancer is.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.       Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat melanoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biologic therapy.     The following types of immunotherapy are being used in the treatment of melanoma:            -  Immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy: Some types of immune cells, such as T cells, and some cancer cells have certain proteins, called checkpoint proteins, on their surface that keep immune responses in check. When cancer cells have large amounts of these proteins, they will not be attacked and killed by T cells. Immune checkpoint inhibitors block these proteins and the ability of T cells to kill cancer cells is increased. They are used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. There are two types of immune checkpoint inhibitor therapy:                  -  CTLA-4 inhibitor: CTL4-A is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When CTLA-4 attaches to another protein called B7 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. CTLA-4 inhibitors attach to CTLA-4 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Ipilimumab is a type of CTLA-4 inhibitor.       -  PD-1 inhibitor: PD-1 is a protein on the surface of T cells that helps keep the bodys immune responses in check. When PD-1 attaches to another protein called PDL-1 on a cancer cell, it stops the T cell from killing the cancer cell. PD-1 inhibitors attach to PDL-1 and allow the T cells to kill cancer cells. Pembrolizumab and nivolumab are types of PD-1 inhibitors.                -  Interferon: Interferon affects the division of cancer cells and can slow tumor growth.     -  Interleukin-2 (IL-2): IL-2 boosts the growth and activity of many immune cells, especially lymphocytes (a type of white blood cell). Lymphocytes can attack and kill cancer cells.     -  Tumor necrosis factor (TNF) therapy: TNF is a protein made by white blood cells in response to an antigen or infection. TNF is made in the laboratory and used as a treatment to kill cancer cells. It is being studied in the treatment of melanoma.           See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. The following types of targeted therapy are used or being studied in the treatment of melanoma:             -  Signal transduction inhibitor therapy: Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells.                   -  Vemurafenib, dabrafenib, trametinib, and cobimetinib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat some patients with advanced melanoma or tumors that cannot be removed by surgery. Vemurafenib and dabrafenib block the activity of proteins made by mutant BRAF genes. Trametinib and cobimetinib affect the growth and survival of cancer cells.                -  Oncolytic virus therapy: A type of targeted therapy that is used in the treatment of melanoma. Oncolytic virus therapy uses a virus that infects and breaks down cancer cells but not normal cells. Radiation therapy or chemotherapy may be given after oncolytic virus therapy to kill more cancer cells.      -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: A type of targeted therapy that is being studied in the treatment of melanoma. Angiogenesis inhibitors block the growth of new blood vessels. In cancer treatment, they may be given to prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.            New targeted therapies and combinations of therapies are being studied in the treatment of melanoma.    See Drugs Approved for Melanoma for more information.

                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:                - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Peripheral blood smear : A procedure in which a sample of blood is checked for cells that look ""hairy,"" the number and kinds of white blood cells, the number of platelets, and changes in the shape of blood cells.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -   Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test in which the antigens or markers on the surface of a blood or bone marrow cell are checked to see what type of cell it is. This test is done to diagnose the specific type of leukemia by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.    -   Flow cytometry : A laboratory test that measures the number of cells in a sample, the percentage of live cells in a sample, and certain characteristics of cells, such as size, shape, and the presence of tumor markers on the cell surface. The cells are stained with a light-sensitive dye, placed in a fluid, and passed in a stream before a laser or other type of light. The measurements are based on how the light-sensitive dye reacts to the light.    -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under a microscope to look for certain changes in the chromosomes.     -   Gene mutation test: A laboratory test done on a bone marrow or blood sample to check for mutations in the BRAF gene. A BRAF gene mutation is often found in patients with hairy cell leukemia.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.

- The number of red blood cells: In hairy cell leukemia, this number may be lower than normal.
- The number of white blood cells: The count can also be lower due to the presence of abnormal hairy cells that crowd out healthy white blood cells.
- The number of platelets: This may also be lower than normal.
- The amount of hemoglobin: This protein carries oxygen in red blood cells, and its levels can provide insights into the patient's overall blood health.
- The proportion of the blood sample constituted by red blood cells.

                    - After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.    - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:         - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV        - Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:         - Low-risk endometrial cancer     - High-risk endometrial cancer
                
                
                    After endometrial cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether the cancer has spread within the uterus or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Certain tests and procedures are used in the staging process. A hysterectomy (an operation in which the uterus is removed) will usually be done to treat endometrial cancer. Tissue samples are taken from the area around the uterus and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer to help find out whether the cancer has spread.   The following procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body.

Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which the lymph nodes are removed from the pelvic area and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if endometrial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually endometrial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic endometrial cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for endometrial cancer:
                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.             -  Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).     -  Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.              Stage II     In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.        Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.            -  Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.      -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina and/or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.
                
                
                    Endometrial cancer may be grouped for treatment as follows:
                    Low-risk endometrial cancer     Grades 1 and 2 tumors are usually considered low-risk. They usually do not spread to other parts of the body.       High-risk endometrial cancer     Grade 3 tumors are considered high-risk. They often spread to other parts of the body. Uterine papillary serous, clear cell, and carcinosarcoma are three subtypes of endometrial cancer that are considered grade 3.","Common tests performed to determine the stage of endometrial cancer after diagnosis include:

                    Gastrointestinal stromal tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the gastrointestinal tract.
                    The gastrointestinal (GI) tract is part of the bodys digestive system. It helps to digest food and takes nutrients (vitamins, minerals, carbohydrates, fats, proteins, and water) from food so they can be used by the body. The GI tract is made up of the following organs:         -  Stomach.    -  Small intestine.    -  Large intestine (colon).         Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) may be malignant (cancer) or benign (not cancer). They are most common in the stomach and small intestine but may be found anywhere in or near the GI tract. Some scientists believe that GISTs begin in cells called interstitial cells of Cajal (ICC), in the wall of the GI tract.      See the PDQ summary about Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment for information on the treatment of GIST in children.
                
                 
                    Very small GISTs are common.
                    Sometimes GISTs are smaller than the eraser on top of a pencil. Tumors may be found during a procedure that is done for another reason, such as an x-ray or surgery. Some of these small tumors will not grow and cause signs or symptoms or spread to the abdomen or other parts of the body. Doctors do not agree on whether these small tumors should be removed or whether they should be watched to see if they begin to grow.","Factors that might increase an individual's risk of developing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) include genetic factors, specifically inherited mutations in certain genes. These genetic influences can significantly impact the disease's onset. For instance, individuals who inherit mutations linked to genetic syndromes such as Neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1) or Carney triad have a greater likelihood of developing GISTs. Additionally, family history plays a role, with GISTs sometimes found in multiple members of the same family, indicating a heritable component. Overall, while having these risk factors does not guarantee that an individual will develop GISTs, they are associated with an increased risk of the disease.",665,"What factors might increase an individual's risk of developing gastrointestinal stromal tumors, and how do these genetic influences impact the disease's onset?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about factors that might increase the risk of developing gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and specifically discusses genetic factors.

"Being exposed to ultraviolet radiation may increase the risk of skin cancer. Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. People who think they may be at risk should discuss this with their doctor.    Being exposed to ultraviolet (UV) radiation and having skin that is sensitive to UV radiation are risk factors for skin cancer. UV radiation is the name for the invisible rays that are part of the energy that comes from the sun. Sunlamps and tanning beds also give off UV radiation.   Risk factors for nonmelanoma and melanoma cancers are not the same.         -  Nonmelanoma skin cancer risk factors include:               - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.      - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                        - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.         - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                      - Having actinic keratosis.       - Past treatment with radiation.      - Having a weakened immune system.       - Being exposed to arsenic.             -  Melanoma skin cancer risk factors include:               - Having a fair complexion, which includes the following:                         - Fair skin that freckles and burns easily, does not tan, or tans poorly.          - Blue or green or other light-colored eyes.          - Red or blond hair.                     - Being exposed to natural sunlight or artificial sunlight (such as from tanning beds) over long periods of time.       - Having a history of many blistering sunburns, especially as a child or teenager.       - Having several large or many small moles.      - Having a family history of unusual moles (atypical nevus syndrome).      -  Having a family or personal history of melanoma.       - Being white.","A history of sunburns, particularly blistering sunburns during childhood or teenage years, can significantly increase a person's risk for melanoma skin cancer. This susceptibility is linked to the damage caused by ultraviolet (UV) radiation from sun exposure, which can lead to mutations in the melanocyte cells that produce melanin, the pigment responsible for skin color. Having multiple blistering sunburns is specifically noted as a risk factor for melanoma, indicating that the intensity and nature of sunburns during formative years may have long-lasting effects on an individual's risk for developing this more aggressive type of skin cancer later in life.",233,"In what ways can a history of sunburns affect a person's risk for melanoma skin cancer, particularly during childhood or teenage years?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the question about how a history of sunburns can affect the risk of melanoma skin cancer, particularly focusing on childhood and teenage years.

                    Non-small cell lung cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the lung.
                    The lungs are a pair of cone-shaped breathing organs in the chest. The lungs bring oxygen into the body as you breathe in. They release carbon dioxide, a waste product of the bodys cells, as you breathe out. Each lung has sections called lobes. The left lung has two lobes. The right lung is slightly larger and has three lobes. Two tubes called bronchi lead from the trachea (windpipe) to the right and left lungs. The bronchi are sometimes also involved in lung cancer. Tiny air sacs called alveoli and small tubes called bronchioles make up the inside of the lungs.     A thin membrane called the pleura covers the outside of each lung and lines the inside wall of the chest cavity. This creates a sac called the pleural cavity. The pleural cavity normally contains a small amount of fluid that helps the lungs move smoothly in the chest when you breathe.    There are two main types of lung cancer: non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information about lung cancer:         -  Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment     -  Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment     -  Lung Cancer Prevention     -  Lung Cancer Screening
                
                
                    There are several types of non-small cell lung cancer.
                    Each type of non-small cell lung cancer has different kinds of cancer cells. The cancer cells of each type grow and spread in different ways. The types of non-small cell lung cancer are named for the kinds of cells found in the cancer and how the cells look under a microscope:         -  Squamous cell carcinoma: Cancer that begins in squamous cells, which are thin, flat cells that look like fish scales. This is also called epidermoid carcinoma.    -  Large cell carcinoma: Cancer that may begin in several types of large cells.    -  Adenocarcinoma: Cancer that begins in the cells that line the alveoli and make substances such as mucus.         Other less common types of non-small cell lung cancer are: pleomorphic, carcinoid tumor, salivary gland carcinoma, and unclassified carcinoma.
                
                
                    For most patients with non-small cell lung cancer, current treatments do not cure the cancer.
                    If lung cancer is found, taking part in one of the many clinical trials being done to improve treatment should be considered. Clinical trials are taking place in most parts of the country for patients with all stages of non-small cell lung cancer. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","It is important for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) to consider participating in clinical trials because current standard treatments do not cure the cancer for most patients. Engaging in clinical trials may offer access to new treatments that are being tested and could be more effective than existing options. 

Some potential benefits of participation in clinical trials include:

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may receive new therapies that are not yet available to the public, potentially improving treatment outcomes.
2. **Contributing to Research**: Participation helps advance cancer research and might lead to discoveries that improve future patient care.
3. **Standard Treatment Comparison**: Many trials compare new treatments against standard ones, allowing patients to potentially benefit from enhancements in care.
4. **Monitoring and Care**: Participants often receive more frequent health assessments and monitoring throughout the trial, providing additional support and care.

Overall, taking part in a clinical trial presents an opportunity not only for individual patients to possibly improve their condition but also for contributing to the broader fight against NSCLC.",0,"Why is it important for patients with non-small cell lung cancer to consider participating in clinical trials, and what are some potential benefits of this participation?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of considering clinical trials for patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and discusses potential benefits, which aligns well with the original answer's focus on the fact that current treatments do not cure the cancer.

                    After testicular cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the testicles or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Abdominal lymph node dissection : A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes in the abdomen are removed and a sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called lymphadenectomy. For patients with nonseminoma, removing the lymph nodes may help stop the spread of disease. Cancer cells in the lymph nodes of seminoma patients can be treated with radiation therapy.     -   Serum tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood is examined to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following 3 tumor markers are used in staging testicular cancer:               -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP)      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).       -  Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH).         Tumor marker levels are measured again, after inguinal orchiectomy and biopsy, in order to determine the stage of the cancer. This helps to show if all of the cancer has been removed or if more treatment is needed. Tumor marker levels are also measured during follow-up as a way of checking if the cancer has come back.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if testicular cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually testicular cancer cells. The disease is metastatic testicular cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for testicular cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Testicular Intraepithelial Neoplasia)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the tiny tubules where the sperm cells begin to develop. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. All tumor marker levels are normal. Stage 0 is also called testicular intraepithelial neoplasia and testicular intratubular germ cell neoplasia.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IS and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IA, cancer is in the testicle and epididymis and may have spread to the inner layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle. All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IB, cancer:                   -  is in the testicle and the epididymis and has spread to the blood vessels or lymph vessels in the testicle; or       - has spread to the outer layer of the membrane surrounding the testicle; or       - is in the spermatic cord or the scrotum and may be in the blood vessels or lymph vessels of the testicle.           All tumor marker levels are normal.     - In stage IS, cancer is found anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or the scrotum and either:                  - all tumor marker levels are slightly above normal; or       - one or more tumor marker levels are moderately above normal or high.                          Stage II     Stage II is divided into stage IIA, stage IIB, and stage IIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIA, cancer:                   - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen, none larger than 2 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIB, cancer is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and either:                  - has spread to up to 5 lymph nodes in the abdomen; at least one of the lymph nodes is larger than 2 centimeters, but none are larger than 5 centimeters; or       - has spread to more than 5 lymph nodes; the lymph nodes are not larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.     - In stage IIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - has spread to a lymph node in the abdomen that is larger than 5 centimeters.           All tumor marker levels are normal or slightly above normal.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC and is determined after an inguinal orchiectomy is done.            - In stage IIIA, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen; and       - has spread to distant lymph nodes or to the lungs.            Tumor marker levels may range from normal to slightly above normal.     - In stage IIIB, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.           The level of one or more tumor markers is moderately above normal.     - In stage IIIC, cancer:                  - is anywhere within the testicle, spermatic cord, or scrotum; and       - may have spread to one or more lymph nodes in the abdomen, to distant lymph nodes, or to the lungs.

1. **Tissue**: The cancer spreads by growing into nearby areas from where it originated.
  
2. **Lymph System**: The cancer cells can enter the lymphatic system, traveling through lymph vessels to reach distant parts of the body, where they may form new (metastatic) tumors.

3. **Blood**: Cancer cells can also enter the bloodstream, allowing them to spread through blood vessels to other organs and tissues, where they can establish secondary tumors.

The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually nasopharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic nasopharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for nasopharyngeal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the nasopharynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only; or     - has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity.           The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils.        Stage II    In stage II nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity. Cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      -  is found in the parapharyngeal space. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one side of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.            The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. The parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.       Stage III     In stage III nasopharyngeal cancer, the cancer:            - is found in the nasopharynx only or has spread from the nasopharynx to the oropharynx and/or to the nasal cavity. Cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      - is found in the parapharyngeal space. Cancer has spread to one or more lymph nodes on both sides of the neck. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller; or      - has spread to nearby bones or sinuses. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.            The oropharynx is the middle part of the throat and includes the soft palate, the base of the tongue, and the tonsils. The parapharyngeal space is a fat-filled, triangular area near the pharynx, between the base of the skull and the lower jaw.       Stage IV     Stage IV nasopharyngeal cancer is divided into stages IVA, IVB, and IVC.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread beyond the nasopharynx and may have spread to the cranial nerves, the hypopharynx (bottom part of the throat), areas in and around the side of the skull or jawbone, and/or the bone around the eye. Cancer may also have spread to one or more lymph nodes on one or both sides of the neck and/or to lymph nodes behind the pharynx. The affected lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes between the collarbone and the top of the shoulder and/or the affected lymph nodes are larger than 6 centimeters.      -  Stage IVC: Cancer has spread beyond nearby lymph nodes to other parts of the body.","Nasopharyngeal cancer, like many cancers, can spread through the lymphatic system and blood due to its malignant cells. This process of spreading is called metastasis. 

1. **Spread through the Lymph System**: In this case, cancer cells break away from the primary tumor located in the nasopharynx, enter the lymphatic vessels, and travel through the lymphatic system to nearby lymph nodes or potentially to distant sites in the body. When these cancer cells establish new tumors in other locations, they form what's known as a metastatic tumor, which retains the characteristics of the original nasopharyngeal cancer cells.

2. **Spread through Blood**: Cancer can also invade the bloodstream. Once the cells enter the blood vessels, they can travel throughout the body and, like in lymphatic spread, can form new tumors in various organs or tissues.

Metastasis, in this context, specifically refers to the phenomenon where cancer cells from the nasopharynx migrate and establish secondary tumors in other locations in the body, indicating that the cancer has progressed beyond its original site. For instance, if nasopharyngeal cancer spreads to the lungs, the cells in the lung tissue would still be classified as nasopharyngeal cancer cells, not lung cancer cells.",260,"Can you explain how nasopharyngeal cancer can spread through the lymph system and blood, and what constitutes metastasis in this context?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the specific concepts of how nasopharyngeal cancer can spread through the lymph system and blood, which aligns with the original answer's explanations. It also accurately describes the metastasis process, maintaining consistency with the information provided about cancer spreading and the classification of metastatic tumors."
"Most people with CML have a gene mutation (change) called the Philadelphia chromosome. Every cell in the body contains DNA (genetic material) that determines how the cell looks and acts. DNA is contained inside chromosomes. In CML, part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another chromosome. This change is called the  Philadelphia chromosome. It results in the bone marrow making an enzyme, called tyrosine kinase, that causes too many stem cells to become white blood cells (granulocytes or blasts).   The Philadelphia chromosome is not passed from parent to child.","The presence of the Philadelphia chromosome in patients with Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML) leads to the overproduction of white blood cells due to a specific genetic alteration. The Philadelphia chromosome results from a rearrangement of genetic material between two chromosomes, where part of the DNA from one chromosome moves to another. This genetic change causes the bone marrow to produce an enzyme called tyrosine kinase. The unregulated activity of this enzyme prompts too many stem cells to differentiate into white blood cells, particularly granulocytes or blasts, leading to their overproduction in CML patients.",571,How does the presence of the Philadelphia chromosome lead to the overproduction of white blood cells in CML patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of the Philadelphia chromosome in CML, including the genetic rearrangement, the production of tyrosine kinase, and the consequent overproduction of white blood cells. It aligns well with the original answer and provides a clear connection to the question, making it pertinent and informative."

                    After laryngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the larynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose laryngeal cancer are often also used to stage the disease.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if laryngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually laryngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic laryngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for laryngeal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the larynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:            -  Supraglottis: Cancer is in one area of the supraglottis only and the vocal cords can move normally.     -  Glottis: Cancer is in one or both vocal cords and the vocal cords can move normally.     -  Subglottis: Cancer is in the subglottis only.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer is in the larynx only. Stage II laryngeal cancer depends on where cancer began in the larynx:            -  Supraglottis: Cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues.     -  Glottis: Cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally.     - Subglottis: Cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally.               Stage III     Stage III laryngeal cancer depends on whether cancer has spread from the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis.    In stage III cancer of the supraglottis:            -  cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in one area of the supraglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or     - cancer is in more than one area of the supraglottis or surrounding tissues and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.           In stage III cancer of the glottis:            - cancer is in the larynx only and the vocal cords cannot move, and/or cancer is in tissues next to the larynx; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in one or both vocal cords and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller and the vocal cords can move normally; or     - cancer has spread to the supraglottis and/or the subglottis and/or the vocal cords cannot move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.           In stage III cancer of the subglottis:            - cancer is in the larynx and the vocal cords cannot move; cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer is in the subglottis and in one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor; the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - cancer has spread to one or both vocal cords, which may not move normally. Cancer has also spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.              Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stage IVA, stage IVB, and stage IVC. Each substage is the same for cancer in the supraglottis, glottis, or subglottis.            - In stage IVA:                   - cancer has spread through the thyroid cartilage and/or has spread to tissues beyond the larynx such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or       - cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor and the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters, or has spread to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck with none larger than 6 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to tissues beyond the larynx, such as the neck, trachea, thyroid, or esophagus. The vocal cords may not move normally.                 - In stage IVB:                   -  cancer has spread to the space in front of the spinal column, surrounds the carotid artery, or has spread to parts of the chest. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes anywhere in the neck and the lymph nodes may be any size; or       -  cancer has spread to a lymph node that is larger than 6 centimeters and may have spread as far as the space in front of the spinal column, around the carotid artery, or to parts of the chest. The vocal cords may not move normally.                - In stage IVC, cancer has spread to other parts of the body, such as the lungs, liver, or bone.","Stage III laryngeal cancer is characterized by specific features related to the mobility of the vocal cords and the involvement of lymph nodes. The identification criteria are as follows:

1. **Involvement of Vocal Cords**: 
   - In stage III, if cancer originates in the supraglottis or glottis, the vocal cords may not be able to move normally, indicating a more severe degree of involvement.
  
2. **Lymph Node Involvement**: 
   - Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the original tumor, with that lymph node measuring 3 centimeters or smaller. 
   - Additionally, the presence of cancer in one area of the supraglottis along with the lymph node involvement, or cancer in multiple areas of the supraglottis, can also indicate stage III.

3. **Spread to Surrounding Tissues**: 
   - Cancer may be localized to the larynx, but significant mobility impairment of the vocal cords will be noted, reflecting deeper invasion.

4. **Summary of Conditions**: 
   - For supraglottis, glottis, and subglottis cancers, the defining characteristics for stage III may include immobile vocal cords and involvement of one lymph node, either accompanying normal vocal cord movement or not, and possible spread to adjacent tissues.

These indicators help delineate stage III laryngeal cancer from earlier and later stages.",402,How are the specific characteristics of stage III laryngeal cancer identified based on the involvement of the lymph nodes and vocal cord mobility?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately identifies the specific characteristics of stage III laryngeal cancer, directly correlating with the details provided in the original answer. It discusses the involvement of vocal cord mobility, lymph node involvement, and spread to surrounding tissues, effectively summarizing the critical elements associated with stage III cancer as outlined in the original text."

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     One or more of the following surgical procedures may be used to treat nonmelanoma skin cancer or actinic keratosis:            -  Mohs micrographic surgery: The tumor is cut from the skin in thin layers. During surgery, the edges of the tumor and each layer of tumor removed are viewed through a microscope to check for cancer cells. Layers continue to be removed until no more cancer cells are seen. This type of surgery removes as little normal tissue as possible and is often used to remove skin cancer on the face.      - Simple excision: The tumor is cut from the skin along with some of the normal skin around it.      - Shave excision: The abnormal area is shaved off the surface of the skin with a small blade.      -  Electrodesiccation and curettage: The tumor is cut from the skin with a curette (a sharp, spoon-shaped tool). A needle-shaped electrode is then used to treat the area with an electric current that stops the bleeding and destroys cancer cells that remain around the edge of the wound. The process may be repeated one to three times during the surgery to remove all of the cancer.     -  Cryosurgery: A treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue, such as carcinoma in situ. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.     -  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a surface lesion such as a tumor.     -  Dermabrasion: Removal of the top layer of skin using a rotating wheel or small particles to rub away skin cells.              Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat skin cancer.       Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Chemotherapy for nonmelanoma skin cancer and actinic keratosis is usually topical (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the condition being treated.     Retinoids (drugs related to vitamin A) are sometimes used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin.    See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.       Photodynamic therapy     Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is a cancer treatment that uses a drug and a certain type of laser light to kill cancer cells. A drug that is not active until it is exposed to light is injected into a vein. The drug collects more in cancer cells than in normal cells. For skin cancer, laser light is shined onto the skin and the drug becomes active and kills the cancer cells. Photodynamic therapy causes little damage to healthy tissue.       Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Interferon and imiquimod are biologic agents used to treat skin cancer. Interferon (by injection) may be used to treat squamous cell carcinoma of the skin. Topical imiquimod therapy (a cream applied to the skin) may be used to treat some small basal cell carcinomas.    See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do.     Targeted therapy with a signal transduction inhibitor is used to treat basal cell carcinoma. Signal transduction inhibitors block signals that are passed from one molecule to another inside a cell. Blocking these signals may kill cancer cells. Vismodegib and sonidegib are signal transduction inhibitors used to treat basal cell carcinoma.     See Drugs Approved for Basal Cell Carcinoma for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Treatment for skin cancer may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are likely to recur (come back), usually within 5 years, or new tumors may form. Talk to your doctor about how often you should have your skin checked for signs of cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with myelodysplastic syndromes. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Treatment for myelodysplastic syndromes includes supportive care, drug therapy, and stem cell transplantation.
                    Patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome who have symptoms caused by low blood counts are given supportive care to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life. Drug therapy may be used to slow progression of the disease. Certain patients can be cured with aggressive treatment with chemotherapy followed by stem cell transplant using stem cells from a donor.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Supportive care     Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care may include the following:                  -  Transfusion therapy   Transfusion therapy (blood transfusion) is a method of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or treatment. A red blood cell transfusion is given when the red blood cell count is low and signs or symptoms of anemia, such as shortness of breath or feeling very tired, occur. A platelet transfusion is usually given when the patient is bleeding, is having a procedure that may cause bleeding, or when the platelet count is very low.  Patients who receive many blood cell transfusions may have tissue and organ damage caused by the buildup of extra iron. These patients may be treated with iron chelation therapy to remove the extra iron from the blood.        -  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents   Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents (ESAs) may be given to increase the number of mature red blood cells made by the body and to lessen the effects of anemia. Sometimes granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) is given with ESAs to help the treatment work better.        -  Antibiotic therapy   Antibiotics may be given to fight infection.                    Drug therapy                  -  Lenalidomide  Patients with myelodysplastic syndrome associated with an isolated del(5q) chromosome abnormality who need frequent red blood cell transfusions may be treated with lenalidomide. Lenalidomide is used to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions.       -  Immunosuppressive therapy   Antithymocyte globulin (ATG) works to suppress or weaken the immune system. It is used to lessen the need for red blood cell transfusions.       -  Azacitidine and decitabine   Azacitidine and decitabine are used to treat myelodysplastic syndromes by killing cells that are dividing rapidly. They also help genes that are involved in cell growth to work the way they should. Treatment with azacitidine and decitabine may slow the progression of myelodysplastic syndromes to acute myeloid leukemia.       -  Chemotherapy used in acute myeloid leukemia (AML)  Patients with a myelodysplastic syndrome and a high number of blasts in their bone marrow have a high risk of acute leukemia. They may be treated with the same chemotherapy regimen used in patients with acute myeloid leukemia.                    Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    Stem cell transplant is a method of giving chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor and are frozen for storage. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.     This treatment may not work as well in patients whose myelodysplastic syndrome was caused by past treatment for cancer.

                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their treatment.

                    Thermography     Thermography is a procedure in which a special camera that senses heat is used to record the temperature of the skin that covers the breasts. A computer makes a map of the breast showing the changes in temperature. Tumors can cause temperature changes that may show up on the thermogram.     There have been no clinical trials of thermography to find out how well it detects breast cancer or if having the procedure decreases the risk of dying from breast cancer.       Tissue sampling    Breast tissue sampling is taking cells from breast tissue to check under a microscope. Abnormal cells in breast fluid have been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer in some studies. Scientists are studying whether breast tissue sampling can be used to find breast cancer at an early stage or predict the risk of developing breast cancer. Three ways of taking tissue samples are being studied:            -  Fine-needle aspiration: A thin needle is inserted into the breast tissue around the areola (darkened area around the nipple) to take out a sample of cells and fluid.     - Nipple aspiration: The use of gentle suction to collect fluid through the nipple. This is done with a device similar to the breast pumps used by women who are breast-feeding.     -  Ductal lavage: A hair-size catheter (tube) is inserted into the nipple and a small amount of salt water is released into the duct. The water picks up breast cells and is removed.               Screening clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country.

"Tests that examine the nose and throat are used to detect (find) and diagnose nasopharyngeal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as swollen lymph nodes in the neck or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:               -  Nasoscopy : A procedure to look inside the nose for abnormal areas. A nasoscope is inserted through the nose. A nasoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.       -  Upper endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the nose, throat, esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.             -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. PET scans may be used to find nasopharyngeal cancers that have spread to the bone. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               -  The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -  Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) test: A blood test to check for antibodies to the Epstein-Barr virus and DNA markers of the Epstein-Barr virus.

A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Digital rectal exam (DRE): An exam of the rectum. The doctor or nurse inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum and feels the prostate through the rectal wall for lumps or abnormal areas.     -   Prostate-specific antigen (PSA) test : A test that measures the level of PSA in the blood. PSA is a substance made by the prostate that may be found in an increased amount in the blood of men who have prostate cancer. PSA levels may also be high in men who have an infection or inflammation of the prostate or BPH (an enlarged, but noncancerous, prostate).    -   Transrectal ultrasound : A procedure in which a probe that is about the size of a finger is inserted into the rectum to check the prostate. The probe is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. Transrectal ultrasound may be used during a biopsy procedure.    -  Transrectal magnetic resonance imaging (MRI): A procedure that uses a strong magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A probe that gives off radio waves is inserted into the rectum near the prostate. This helps the MRI machine make clearer pictures of the prostate and nearby tissue. A transrectal MRI is done to find out if the cancer has spread outside the prostate into nearby tissues. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  Biopsy: The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist. The pathologist will check the tissue sample to see if there are cancer cells and find out the Gleason score.

                    Skin cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the skin.
                    The skin is the bodys largest organ. It protects against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. Skin also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The skin has several layers, but the two main layers are the epidermis (upper or outer layer) and the dermis (lower or inner layer).     The epidermis is made up of 3 kinds of cells:         -  Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells that make up most of the epidermis.    -  Basal cells are the round cells under the squamous cells.    -  Melanocytes are found throughout the lower part of the epidermis. They make melanin, the pigment that gives skin its natural color. When skin is exposed to the sun, melanocytes make more pigment, causing the skin to tan, or darken.        The dermis contains blood and lymph vessels, hair follicles, and glands.     See the following PDQ summaries for more information about skin cancer:         -  Skin Cancer Screening     -  Skin Cancer Treatment     -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Genetics of Skin Cancer
                
                
                    There are several types of skin cancer.
                    The most common types of skin cancer are squamous cell carcinoma, which forms in the squamous cells and basal cell carcinoma, which forms in the basal cells. Squamous cell carcinoma and basal cell carcinoma are also called nonmelanoma skin cancers. Melanoma, which forms in the melanocytes, is a less common type of skin cancer that grows and spreads quickly.    Skin cancer can occur anywhere on the body, but it is most common in areas exposed to sunlight, such as the face, neck, hands, and arms.
                
                
                    Skin cancer is the most common cancer in the United States.
                    Basal cell carcinoma and squamous cell carcinoma are the most common types of skin cancer in the United States. The number of new cases of nonmelanoma skin cancer appears to be increasing every year. These nonmelanoma skin cancers can usually be cured.   The number of new cases of melanoma has been increasing for at least 30 years. Melanoma is more likely to spread to nearby tissues and other parts of the body and can be harder to cure. Finding and treating melanoma skin cancer early may help prevent death from melanoma.","The skin provides several protective functions, including safeguarding against heat, sunlight, injury, and infection. It also helps control body temperature and stores water, fat, and vitamin D. The outermost layer, the epidermis, is particularly significant as skin cancer begins in this layer.

Damage to these protective functions can increase the risk of developing skin cancer in several ways. For instance, prolonged exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation, a risk factor for skin cancer, can lead to mutations in the skin cells, particularly in those responsible for making melanin (melanocytes), or in the squamous and basal cells. Additionally, a compromised skin barrier due to injury or disease may make the skin more susceptible to harmful environmental factors. When the skin's ability to protect itself is diminished, it can lead to the development of conditions such as actinic keratosis, which can progress to squamous cell carcinoma, a type of nonmelanoma skin cancer.",205,"What protective functions does the skin provide, and how might damage to these functions contribute to the risk of developing skin cancer?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides information about the skin's protective functions and how damage to these functions can lead to an increased risk of skin cancer, which connects to the original answer.

                    After childhood rhabdomyosarcoma has been diagnosed, treatment is based in part on the stage of the cancer and sometimes it is based on whether all the cancer was removed by surgery.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the tissue or to other parts of the body is called staging. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The doctor will use results of the diagnostic tests to help find out the stage of the disease.   Treatment for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is based in part on the stage and sometimes on the amount of cancer that remains after surgery to remove the tumor. The pathologist will use a microscope to check the tissues removed during surgery, including tissue samples from the edges of the areas where the cancer was removed and the lymph nodes. This is done to see if all the cancer cells were taken out during the surgery.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                 
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if rhabdomyosarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually rhabdomyosarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    Staging of childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is done in three parts.
                    Childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is staged by using three different ways to describe the cancer:         - A staging system.    - A grouping system.    - A risk group.
                
                
                    The staging system is based on the size of the tumor, where it is in the body, and whether it has spread to other parts of the body:
                    Stage 1    In stage 1, the tumor is any size, may have spread to lymph nodes, and is found in only one of the following ""favorable"" sites:            - Eye or area around the eye.     - Head and neck (but not in the tissue next to the brain and spinal cord).     -  Gallbladder and bile ducts.     -  Ureters or urethra.     -  Testes, ovary, vagina, or uterus.            Rhabdomyosarcoma that forms in a ""favorable"" site has a better prognosis. If the site where cancer occurs is not one of the favorable sites listed above, it is said to be an ""unfavorable"" site.        Stage 2    In stage 2, cancer is found in an ""unfavorable"" site (any one area not described as ""favorable"" in stage 1). The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and has not spread to lymph nodes.        Stage 3    In stage 3, cancer is found in an ""unfavorable"" site (any one area not described as ""favorable"" in stage 1) and one of the following is true:             - The tumor is no larger than 5 centimeters and cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes.     - The tumor is larger than 5 centimeters and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.              Stage 4    In stage 4, the tumor may be any size and cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. Cancer has spread to distant parts of the body, such as the lung, bone marrow, or bone.
                
                
                    The grouping system is based on whether the cancer has spread and whether all the cancer was removed by surgery:
                    Group I     Cancer was found only in the place where it started and it was completely removed by surgery. Tissue was taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed. The tissue was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and no cancer cells were found.       Group II    Group II is divided into groups IIA, IIB, and IIC.            - IIA: Cancer was removed by surgery but cancer cells were seen when the tissue, taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed, was viewed under a microscope by a pathologist.     - IIB: Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes and the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery.     - IIC: Cancer had spread to nearby lymph nodes, the cancer and lymph nodes were removed by surgery, and at least one of the following is true:                  - Tissue taken from the edges of where the tumor was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.       - The furthest lymph node from the tumor that was removed was checked under a microscope by a pathologist and cancer cells were seen.                         Group III     Cancer was partly removed by biopsy or surgery but there is tumor remaining that can be seen with the eye.        Group IV     Cancer had spread to distant parts of the body when the cancer was diagnosed.            - Cancer cells are found by an imaging test; or     - There are cancer cells in the fluid around the brain, spinal cord, or lungs, or in fluid in the abdomen; or tumors are found in those areas.
                
                
                    The risk group is based on the staging system and the grouping system.
                    The risk group describes the chance that rhabdomyosarcoma will recur (come back). Every child treated for rhabdomyosarcoma should receive chemotherapy to decrease the chance cancer will recur. The type of anticancer drug, dose, and the number of treatments given depends on whether the child has low-risk, intermediate-risk, or high-risk rhabdomyosarcoma.    The following risk groups are used:     Low-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    Low-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following:            - An embryonal tumor of any size that is found in a ""favorable"" site. There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes. The following areas are ""favorable"" sites:                   - Eye or area around the eye.       - Head or neck (but not in the tissue near the ear, nose, sinuses, or base of the skull).       -  Gallbladder and bile ducts.       -  Ureter or urethra.       -  Testes, ovary, vagina, or uterus.                 - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in a ""favorable"" site. There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen only with a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.              Intermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    Intermediate-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma is one of the following:            - An embryonal tumor of any size that is not found in one of the ""favorable"" sites listed above. There is tumor remaining after surgery, that can be seen with or without a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.     - An alveolar tumor of any size in a ""favorable"" or ""unfavorable"" site. There may be tumor remaining after surgery that can be seen with or without a microscope. The cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.              High-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma    High-risk childhood rhabdomyosarcoma may be the embryonal type or the alveolar type. It may have spread to nearby lymph nodes and has spread to one or more of the following:            - Other parts of the body that are not near where the tumor first formed.     -  Fluid around the brain or spinal cord.     -  Fluid in the lung or abdomen.","In the grouping system for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma, Group I is distinguished from Group IV by the extent of cancer spread and the completeness of surgical removal. 

- **Group I:** Cancer was found only in the original site where it started, and it was completely removed by surgery. No cancer cells were detected in the tissue examined from the edges of the removal area.

- **Group IV:** Cancer had spread to distant parts of the body at the time of diagnosis. This may include metastasis characterized by cancer cells detected in other areas, such as the lungs or fluid around the brain, spinal cord, or in the abdomen. 

Thus, the key distinction lies in whether the cancer is localized to its original site and completely removed (Group I) versus whether it has metastasized to distant sites (Group IV).",562,What distinguishes Group I from Group IV in the grouping system for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer clearly distinguishes Group I from Group IV in the grouping system for childhood rhabdomyosarcoma by accurately describing the conditions of cancer spread and surgical removal. It aligns well with the original answer, which defines Group I as localized and completely removed while defining Group IV as having distant spread at diagnosis. The content is consistent, clear, and directly answers the question asked."
"Breast exams should be part of prenatal and postnatal care.
		                    To detect breast cancer, pregnant and nursing women should examine their breasts themselves. Women should also receive clinical breast exams during their regular prenatal and postnatal check-ups. Talk to your doctor if you notice any changes in your breasts that you do not expect or that worry you.
		        
		        
		                    Tests that examine the breasts are used to detect (find) and diagnose breast cancer.
		                    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -  Clinical breast exam (CBE): An exam of the breast by a doctor or other health professional. The doctor will carefully feel the breasts and under the arms for lumps or anything else that seems unusual.     -    MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of both breasts. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to look at later.    -   Mammogram : An x-ray of the breast. A mammogram can be done with little risk to the unborn baby. Mammograms in pregnant women may appear negative even though cancer is present.     -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. If a lump in the breast is found, a biopsy may be done. There are four types of breast biopsies:               -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump of tissue.       -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.       -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle.       -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue or fluid, using a thin needle.
		        
		        
		                    If cancer is found, tests are done to study the cancer cells.
		                    Decisions about the best treatment are based on the results of these tests and the age of the unborn baby. The tests give information about:         - How quickly the cancer may grow.    - How likely it is that the cancer will spread to other parts of the body.    - How well certain treatments might work.    - How likely the cancer is to recur (come back).        Tests may include the following:         -   Estrogen and progesterone receptor test : A test to measure the amount of estrogen and progesterone (hormones) receptors in cancer tissue. If there are more estrogen and progesterone receptors than normal, the cancer is called estrogen and/or progesterone receptor positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly. The test results show whether treatment to block estrogen and progesterone given after the baby is born may stop the cancer from growing.    -   Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) test : A laboratory test to measure how many HER2/neu genes there are and how much HER2/neu protein is made in a sample of tissue. If there are more HER2/neu genes or higher levels of HER2/neu protein than normal, the cancer is called HER2/neu positive. This type of breast cancer may grow more quickly and is more likely to spread to other parts of the body. The cancer may be treated with drugs that target the HER2/neu protein, such as trastuzumab and pertuzumab, after the baby is born.    -  Multigene tests: Tests in which samples of tissue are studied to look at the activity of many genes at the same time. These tests may help predict whether cancer will spread to other parts of the body or recur (come back).               -  Oncotype DX : This test helps predict whether stage I or stage II breast cancer that is estrogen receptor positive and node-negative will spread to other parts of the body. If the risk of the cancer spreading is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.      -  MammaPrint : This test helps predict whether stage I or stage II breast cancer that is node-negative will spread to other parts of the body. If the risk of the cancer spreading is high, chemotherapy may be given to lower the risk.","The estrogen and progesterone receptor tests play a critical role in determining treatment options for breast cancer patients, including those who are pregnant. These tests measure the levels of estrogen and progesterone receptors in cancer tissue. If the tests show that the cancer is hormone receptor positive (having more receptors than normal), it indicates that the cancer may grow more quickly and may respond well to treatments that block these hormones.

For breast cancer patients who are pregnant, treatment plans may be influenced by the timing of the pregnancy and the receptor status of the cancer. Generally, hormone therapy aimed at blocking estrogen and progesterone is considered after the baby is born. This is due to concerns regarding the safety of such treatments during pregnancy, as well as the need to prioritize the health of both the mother and the unborn child.

In summary, the results of hormone receptor tests help guide oncologists in deciding which treatments to use, particularly delaying hormone therapy until after delivery for pregnant women, ensuring both maternal and fetal safety while managing the cancer effectively.",661,"How do estrogen and progesterone receptor tests influence the treatment options for breast cancer patients, particularly those who are pregnant?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the role of estrogen and progesterone receptor tests in influencing treatment options for breast cancer patients, particularly during pregnancy. It summarizes the importance of these tests in determining treatment plans and emphasizes the need to prioritize the health of both the mother and the unborn child, which aligns closely with the original answer's details about treatment considerations for pregnant women."
"Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level can be a sign of cancer or another condition such as endometriosis.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. Some patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.","A CT scan plays a vital role in the overall diagnostic process for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer by helping to determine whether cancer cells have spread within the ovaries or to other parts of the body after diagnosis. This imaging technique assists in staging the disease, which is crucial for planning the appropriate treatment. CT scans are often utilized alongside other tests to accurately assess the extent of cancer spread, guiding decisions regarding surgical intervention and other therapeutic strategies. Understanding the stage of the cancer is fundamental for developing a comprehensive treatment plan tailored to each patient's condition.",490,"What role does a CT scan play in the overall diagnostic process for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer focuses specifically on the role of the CT scan in the diagnostic process for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer, which is related to the original answer. However, it does not encompass the broader context of multiple diagnostic tests mentioned in the original answer. While it correctly highlights the importance of CT scans in terms of staging and treatment planning, it lacks reference to the other diagnostic methods outlined, making it partly relevant rather than fully relevant."
"Key Points
                    - Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer.    - The following are risk factors for lung cancer:         - Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking      - Secondhand smoke     - Family history     - HIV infection     - Environmental risk factors     - Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers        - The following are protective factors for lung cancer:         - Not smoking     - Quitting smoking     - Lower exposure to workplace risk factors      - Lower exposure to radon        - It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer:         - Diet     - Physical activity        - The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer:         - Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers     - Vitamin E supplements         - Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.    -  New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                
                
                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent lung cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following are risk factors for lung cancer:
                    Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking      Tobacco smoking is the most important risk factor for lung cancer. Cigarette, cigar, and pipe smoking all increase the risk of lung cancer. Tobacco smoking causes about 9 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in men and about 8 out of 10 cases of lung cancer in women.    Studies have shown that smoking low tar or low nicotine cigarettes does not lower the risk of lung cancer.     Studies also show that the risk of lung cancer from smoking cigarettes increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day and the number of years smoked. People who smoke have about 20 times the risk of lung cancer compared to those who do not smoke.       Secondhand smoke    Being exposed to secondhand tobacco smoke is also a risk factor for lung cancer. Secondhand smoke is the smoke that comes from a burning cigarette or other tobacco product, or that is exhaled by smokers. People who inhale secondhand smoke are exposed to the same cancer -causing agents as smokers, although in smaller amounts. Inhaling secondhand smoke is called involuntary or passive smoking.       Family history    Having a family history of lung cancer is a risk factor for lung cancer. People with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to have lung cancer as people who do not have a relative who has had lung cancer. Because cigarette smoking tends to run in families and family members are exposed to secondhand smoke, it is hard to know whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from the family history of lung cancer or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.       HIV infection    Being infected with the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), the cause of acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), is linked with a higher risk of lung cancer. People infected with HIV may have more than twice the risk of lung cancer than those who are not infected. Since smoking rates are higher in those infected with HIV than in those not infected, it is not clear whether the increased risk of lung cancer is from HIV infection or from being exposed to cigarette smoke.        Environmental risk factors            -   Radiation exposure: Being exposed to radiation is a risk factor for lung cancer. Atomic bomb radiation, radiation therapy, imaging tests, and radon are sources of radiation exposure:                   - Atomic bomb radiation: Being exposed to radiation after an atomic bomb explosion increases the risk of lung cancer.       - Radiation therapy: Radiation therapy to the chest may be used to treat certain cancers, including breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma. Radiation therapy uses x-rays, gamma rays, or other types of radiation that may increase the risk of lung cancer. The higher the dose of radiation received, the higher the risk. The risk of lung cancer following radiation therapy is higher in patients who smoke than in nonsmokers.       - Imaging tests: Imaging tests, such as CT scans, expose patients to radiation. Low-dose spiral CT scans expose patients to less radiation than higher dose CT scans. In lung cancer screening, the use of low-dose spiral CT scans can lessen the harmful effects of radiation.       - Radon: Radon is a radioactive gas that comes from the breakdown of uranium in rocks and soil. It seeps up through the ground, and leaks into the air or water supply. Radon can enter homes through cracks in floors, walls, or the foundation, and levels of radon can build up over time.             Studies show that high levels of radon gas inside the home or workplace increase the number of new cases of lung cancer and the number of deaths caused by lung cancer. The risk of lung cancer is higher in smokers exposed to radon than in nonsmokers who are exposed to it. In people who have never smoked, about 30% of deaths caused by lung cancer have been linked to being exposed to radon.     -  Workplace exposure: Studies show that being exposed to the following substances increases the risk of lung cancer:                  -  Asbestos.       -  Arsenic.       - Chromium.       - Nickel.       - Beryllium.       -  Cadmium.       - Tar and soot.            These substances can cause lung cancer in people who are exposed to them in the workplace and have never smoked. As the level of exposure to these substances increases, the risk of lung cancer also increases. The risk of lung cancer is even higher in people who are exposed and also smoke.      -  Air pollution: Studies show that living in areas with higher levels of air pollution increases the risk of lung cancer.              Beta carotene supplements in heavy smokers    Taking beta carotene supplements (pills) increases the risk of lung cancer, especially in smokers who smoke one or more packs a day. The risk is higher in smokers who have at least one alcoholic drink every day.
                
                
                    The following are protective factors for lung cancer:
                    Not smoking    The best way to prevent lung cancer is to not smoke.       Quitting smoking    Smokers can decrease their risk of lung cancer by quitting. In smokers who have been treated for lung cancer, quitting smoking lowers the risk of new lung cancers. Counseling, the use of nicotine replacement products, and antidepressant therapy have helped smokers quit for good.    In a person who has quit smoking, the chance of preventing lung cancer depends on how many years and how much the person smoked and the length of time since quitting. After a person has quit smoking for 10 years, the risk of lung cancer decreases 30% to 50%.    See the following for more information on quitting smoking:            -  Tobacco (includes help with quitting)     -  Cigarette Smoking: Health Risks and How to Quit               Lower exposure to workplace risk factors     Laws that protect workers from being exposed to cancer-causing substances, such as asbestos, arsenic, nickel, and chromium, may help lower their risk of developing lung cancer. Laws that prevent smoking in the workplace help lower the risk of lung cancer caused by secondhand smoke.       Lower exposure to radon     Lowering radon levels may lower the risk of lung cancer, especially among cigarette smokers. High levels of radon in homes may be reduced by taking steps to prevent radon leakage, such as sealing basements.
                
                
                    It is not clear if the following decrease the risk of lung cancer:
                    Diet     Some studies show that people who eat high amounts of fruits or vegetables have a lower risk of lung cancer than those who eat low amounts. However, since smokers tend to have less healthy diets than nonsmokers, it is hard to know whether the decreased risk is from having a healthy diet or from not smoking.       Physical activity    Some studies show that people who are physically active have a lower risk of lung cancer than people who are not. However, since smokers tend to have different levels of physical activity than nonsmokers, it is hard to know if physical activity affects the risk of lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following do not decrease the risk of lung cancer:
                    Beta carotene supplements in nonsmokers    Studies of nonsmokers show that taking beta carotene supplements does not lower their risk of lung cancer.       Vitamin E supplements      Studies show that taking vitamin E supplements does not affect the risk of lung cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent lung cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check the list of NCI-supported cancer clinical trials for prevention trials for non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer that are now accepting patients. These include trials for quitting smoking.","A family history of lung cancer influences an individual's likelihood of developing the disease by significantly increasing that risk. Individuals with a relative who has had lung cancer may be twice as likely to develop lung cancer compared to those without such a family history. This increased risk may be attributed to both genetic factors and shared environmental exposures, such as secondhand smoke. However, since smoking often runs in families, it can be challenging to differentiate between the risk contributed by genetics and that from shared smoking behaviors.",52,In what ways does a family history of lung cancer influence an individual's likelihood of developing the disease?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately reflects key points from the original answer regarding the influence of family history on lung cancer risk. It highlights the increased likelihood of developing lung cancer in individuals with a family history and discusses genetic and environmental factors, aligning well with the information provided in the original answer."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The patient's age and general health.     - The level of certain substances in the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF).    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system, eye, or both.    - Whether the patient has AIDS.         Treatment options depend on the following:          - The stage of the cancer.    - Where the tumor is in the central nervous system.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        Treatment of primary CNS lymphoma works best when the tumor has not spread outside the cerebrum (the largest part of the brain) and the patient is younger than 60 years, able to carry out most daily activities, and does not have AIDS or other diseases that weaken the immune system.","The location of the tumor in the central nervous system (CNS) significantly influences the treatment strategy for Primary CNS Lymphoma in several ways:

1. **Type of Chemotherapy Administered**: The method of chemotherapy delivery may differ based on the tumor's location. For tumors located in the brain, systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy (injected into the cerebrospinal fluid), or intraventricular chemotherapy (injected into the brain’s ventricles) may be utilized. If the tumor is found in the eye, specific chemotherapy may be injected directly into the vitreous humor.

2. **Choice of Radiation Therapy**: Radiation therapy must be tailored to the tumor's location. Whole brain radiation therapy is often employed for primary CNS lymphoma, given its tendency to spread throughout the brain.

3. **Impact on Treatment Planning**: The precise location impacts the overall treatment plan, including the integration of radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The sequential use or combination of these treatments may depend on whether the tumor has spread and where it is situated within the CNS.

4. **Response to Treatment**: The location can also affect how well the tumor responds to treatments, which influences decisions regarding subsequent therapies, adjustments, or the potential for clinical trials based on initial responses.

5. **Prognosis Considerations**: The tumor's location is one of the factors that affect the prognosis and thus influences treatment options available to the patient. 

Overall, successful management of Primary CNS Lymphoma requires a comprehensive approach that considers the tumor's location within the CNS.",436,In what ways does the location of the tumor in the central nervous system affect the treatment strategy for Primary CNS Lymphoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the influence of tumor location in the central nervous system on treatment strategies for Primary CNS Lymphoma, aligning closely with the aspects discussed in the original answer. Both texts emphasize the importance of the tumor's location concerning treatment options and prognosis, making the generated answer highly relevant."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:          - The type of small intestine cancer.     - Whether the cancer is in the inner lining of the small intestine only or has spread into or beyond the wall of the small intestine.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other places in the body, such as the lymph nodes, liver, or peritoneum (tissue that lines the wall of the abdomen and covers most of the organs in the abdomen).    -  Whether the cancer can be completely removed by surgery.    - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred.","The ability to surgically remove cancer significantly impacts the treatment strategy and overall outlook for patients. When a tumor can be completely removed by surgery, as seen with cancers like pancreatic cancer and certain types of childhood liver cancer, it often leads to better prognoses and treatment options. The prognosis improves if the cancer is detected early and has not spread. Conversely, if the cancer has metastasized or is in a later stage where surgical removal is not possible, treatment may shift to palliative care aimed at managing symptoms rather than curing the disease. This can adversely affect the overall outlook for the patient, as the focus becomes on improving quality of life instead of attempting curative measures. Therefore, the initial evaluation of whether a tumor is operable is crucial in determining both the treatment approach and the patient's chances of recovery.",267,In what ways does the ability to surgically remove the cancer affect the treatment strategy and overall outlook for patients?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of the ability to surgically remove cancer on treatment strategies and patient prognosis, which aligns well with the factors affecting prognosis and treatment options outlined in the original answer. It discusses how surgical operability influences outcomes and treatment approaches, effectively covering the key points mentioned in the original response."
"Tests that examine the lymph system are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the neck, chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.              -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node.       -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.          A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.","A CT scan enhances the visibility of lymphatic structures during the diagnostic process for Hodgkin lymphoma by creating detailed images of the body's internal areas, including the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis. This imaging procedure involves taking a series of pictures from different angles, which allows for a comprehensive view of lymph nodes and any potential spread of cancer. Additionally, a contrast dye may be injected to help amplify the visibility of these organs and tissues, enabling healthcare providers to detect the location and extent of Hodgkin lymphoma more effectively. Such detailed imaging helps in determining the stage of the disease, which is crucial for planning treatment.",365,How does a CT scan enhance the visibility of lymphatic structures during the diagnostic process for Hodgkin lymphoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses how a CT scan enhances the visibility of lymphatic structures during the diagnostic process for Hodgkin lymphoma. It reflects the details provided in the original answer about the CT scan procedure, including the creation of detailed images of internal areas, the use of a contrast dye, and the importance of this imaging in detecting cancer and determining its stage. Overall, it accurately captures the essential elements of the original answer."
"A sign of mycosis fungoides is a red rash on the skin. Mycosis fungoides may go through the following phases:         -  Premycotic phase: A scaly, red rash in areas of the body that usually are not exposed to the sun. This rash does not cause symptoms and may last for months or years. It is hard to diagnose the rash as mycosis fungoides during this phase.    -  Patch phase: Thin, reddened, eczema -like rash.    -  Plaque phase: Small raised bumps (papules) or hardened lesions on the skin, which may be reddened.     -  Tumor phase: Tumors form on the skin. These tumors may develop ulcers and the skin may get infected.        Check with your doctor if you have any of these signs.","The eczema-like rash in the patch phase of mycosis fungoides can be differentiated from common eczema by considering its characteristics and context:

1. **Appearance**: The rash in mycosis fungoides is described specifically as a thin, reddened eczema-like rash, which may have distinct features compared to typical eczema that usually presents as itchy, inflamed, and thickened skin.

2. **Stage Context**: In the context of mycosis fungoides, the rash appears during the patch phase, which is part of a progression of the disease that may include other phases (plaque and tumor phases). This progression adds an additional aspect to consider when diagnosing the rash.

3. **Diagnostic Challenges**: The rash in the premycotic phase may be hard to diagnose as mycosis fungoides, suggesting that a thorough evaluation by a healthcare professional is essential to distinguish it from common eczema.

4. **Symptoms**: Unlike systemic symptoms that may accompany classic eczema (like inflammation and itching), the rash in mycosis fungoides does not typically present with these symptoms during the patch phase.

To confirm the diagnosis, additional tests such as skin biopsies and immunophenotyping may be necessary to ascertain whether the lesion is related to malignancy (mycosis fungoides) or is purely inflammatory (common eczema).",496,How can the eczema-like rash in the patch phase of mycosis fungoides be differentiated from common eczema?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question of how to differentiate the eczema-like rash in the patch phase of mycosis fungoides from common eczema. It elaborates on the characteristics, context, and diagnostic challenges related to mycosis fungoides, which aligns well with the information provided in the original answer.

"Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level can be a sign of cancer or another condition such as endometriosis.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. Some patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.","The CA 125 assay is a blood test that measures the level of the cancer antigen CA 125, which is a substance often released by cells in the ovaries. It is primarily used in conjunction with other diagnostic procedures to help diagnose ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers. Elevated levels of CA 125 can indicate the presence of these cancers, as well as other conditions such as endometriosis, pelvic inflammatory disease, or other benign conditions. However, an increased CA 125 level alone is not definitive for a cancer diagnosis, and further tests are usually required to confirm the presence of cancer.",490,"How does the CA 125 assay contribute to the diagnosis of these types of cancer, and what other conditions might it indicate if levels are elevated?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately discusses the CA 125 assay, its role in diagnosing ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancers, and notes the potential for elevated levels to indicate other conditions like endometriosis.

"Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage oropharyngeal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as swollen lymph nodes in the neck or anything else that seems unusual. The medical doctor or dentist does a complete exam of the mouth and neck and looks under the tongue and down the throat with a small, long-handled mirror to check for abnormal areas. An exam of the eyes may be done to check for vision problems that are caused by nerves in the head and neck. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time with the same machine. The combined scans give more detailed pictures of areas inside the body than either scan gives by itself. A PET-CT scan may be used to help diagnose disease, such as cancer, plan treatment, or find out how well treatment is working.               -  CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the head and neck, taken from different angles.

A fine-needle biopsy is usually done to remove a sample of tissue using a thin needle. The following procedures may be used to remove samples of cells or tissue:               -  Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through an incision (cut) in the skin or opening in the body, such as the mouth or nose. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. The nose, throat, back of the tongue, esophagus, stomach, larynx, windpipe, and large airways will be checked. The type of endoscopy is named for the part of the body that is being examined. For example, pharyngoscopy is an exam to check the pharynx.       -  Laryngoscopy : A procedure in which the doctor checks the larynx with a mirror or with a laryngoscope. A laryngoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove abnormal tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.          If cancer is found, the following test may be done to study the cancer cells:               -  HPV test (human papillomavirus test): A laboratory test used to check the sample of tissue for certain types of HPV infection. This test is done because oropharyngeal cancer can be caused by HPV.","Endoscopy plays a crucial role in diagnosing oropharyngeal cancer by allowing doctors to examine the tissues of the oropharynx directly. The procedure generally involves the use of an endoscope, a thin, flexible tube equipped with a camera and light, which is inserted through the mouth into the oropharynx. This examination helps in identifying any abnormal growths, lesions, or other indications of cancer.

During an endoscopic examination, the doctor may also take biopsies—small samples of tissue—for further laboratory analysis. This can help confirm the presence of malignant cells and is important for diagnosing oropharyngeal cancer accurately. Additionally, results from this procedure can provide valuable information for staging the cancer, which is essential in planning the appropriate treatment.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT). Treatment for AT/RT is usually within a clinical trial. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Children with atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with central nervous system cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:          -  Pediatrician.    - Pediatric neurosurgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Geneticist or genetic counselor.
                
                
                    Childhood brain tumors may cause signs or symptoms that begin before the cancer is diagnosed and continue for months or years.
                    Signs or symptoms caused by the tumor may begin before diagnosis. These signs or symptoms may continue for months or years. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about signs or symptoms caused by the tumor that may continue after treatment.
                
                
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Four types of treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is used to diagnose and treat CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor. See the General Information section of this summary.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, most patients will be given chemotherapy and possibly radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing.             - When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Regular doses of anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor. Anticancer drugs injected into the cerebrospinal fluid are able to reach the tumor. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.     - When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). High doses of some anticancer drugs given into a vein can cross the blood-brain barrier and reach the tumor.              Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of tumor being treated and whether it has spread. External radiation therapy may be given to the brain and spinal cord.     Because radiation therapy can affect growth and brain development in young children, especially children who are three years old or younger, the dose of radiation therapy may be lower than in older children.        High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Targeted therapy is being studied in the treatment of recurrent childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.    Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

							                    Because atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor (AT/RT) is fast-growing, a combination of treatments is usually given. After surgery to remove the tumor, treatments for AT/RT may include combinations of the following:         - Chemotherapy.    -  Radiation therapy.    -  High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant.         Clinical trials of new treatments should be considered for patients with newly diagnosed atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor.","The potential long-term side effects of cancer treatments for childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors (AT/RT) can include:

1. **Physical Problems**: This may include challenges related to motor skills or other physical abilities due to damage caused by surgery or radiation therapy.
  
2. **Cognitive and Emotional Changes**: Children may experience alterations in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory as a result of treatment.
  
3. **Second Cancers**: There is a risk for developing new types of cancer later in life as a consequence of the treatments received.

These late effects of treatment can manifest months or years after the initial therapy has concluded. It's vital that families discuss potential side effects with their healthcare providers to monitor and manage them effectively.

Management strategies for these long-term side effects may involve:

- **Regular Follow-Up Care**: Continuous monitoring through follow-up tests to assess any emerging symptoms or complications.
  
- **Rehabilitation Services**: Accessing physical, occupational, or speech therapy to address physical and cognitive challenges.

- **Psychological Support**: Engaging with mental health professionals to support emotional and psychological well-being.

- **Preventive Care**: Staying vigilant regarding signs of second cancers and maintaining regular screenings as recommended by healthcare professionals.

Overall, close collaboration with a pediatric healthcare team is essential to manage and minimize long-term side effects following treatment for childhood CNS AT/RT.",384,"What are the potential long-term side effects of cancer treatments for childhood central nervous system atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor, and how can these be managed?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the potential long-term side effects of cancer treatments for childhood CNS atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumors, aligning closely with the original content which discusses late effects such as physical problems, cognitive changes, and the risk of second cancers.

"Tests that examine the bile ducts and nearby organs are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer. Procedures that make pictures of the bile ducts and the nearby area help diagnose bile duct cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the bile ducts or to distant parts of the body is called staging.    In order to plan treatment, it is important to know if the bile duct cancer can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage bile duct cancer are usually done at the same time.   The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of bilirubin and alkaline phosphatase released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of these substances can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by bile duct cancer.    -   Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.    -   Carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the body. These are called tumor markers. Higher than normal levels of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA) and CA 19-9 may mean there is bile duct cancer.    -   Ultrasound exam : A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -  MRCP (magnetic resonance cholangiopancreatography): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body such as the liver, bile ducts, gallbladder, pancreas, and pancreatic duct.
                    Different procedures may be used to obtain a sample of tissue and diagnose bile duct cancer. Cells and tissues are removed during a biopsy so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. Different procedures may be used to obtain the sample of cells and tissue. The type of procedure used depends on whether the patient is well enough to have surgery.    Types of biopsy procedures include the following:         -   Laparoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the abdomen, such as the bile ducts and liver, to check for signs of cancer. Small incisions (cuts) are made in the wall of the abdomen and a laparoscope (a thin, lighted tube) is inserted into one of the incisions. Other instruments may be inserted through the same or other incisions to perform procedures such as taking tissue samples to be checked for signs of cancer.    -   Percutaneous transhepatic cholangiography (PTC): A procedure used to x-ray the liver and bile ducts. A thin needle is inserted through the skin below the ribs and into the liver. Dye is injected into the liver or bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin, flexible tube called a stent may be left in the liver to drain bile into the small intestine or a collection bag outside the body. This procedure may be used when a patient cannot have surgery.    -   Endoscopic retrograde cholangiopancreatography (ERCP): A procedure used to x-ray the ducts (tubes) that carry bile from the liver to the gallbladder and from the gallbladder to the small intestine. Sometimes bile duct cancer causes these ducts to narrow and block or slow the flow of bile, causing jaundice. An endoscope is passed through the mouth and stomach and into the small intestine. Dye is injected through the endoscope (thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing) into the bile ducts and an x-ray is taken. A sample of tissue is removed and checked for signs of cancer. If the bile duct is blocked, a thin tube may be inserted into the duct to unblock it. This tube (or stent) may be left in place to keep the duct open. This procedure may be used when a patient cannot have surgery.","Staging plays a critical role in the diagnosis and treatment planning of bile duct cancer (cholangiocarcinoma). It involves determining how far the cancer has spread within the bile duct system and to other parts of the body. The information gathered through staging tests is essential for planning treatment options and assessing whether the cancer can be surgically removed.

The staging process includes diagnostic tests and procedures that help identify the size of the tumor, its location, and whether it has spread to nearby tissues, blood vessels, lymph nodes, or distant organs. The findings from these tests inform the categories of bile duct cancer stages, which include:

1. **Resectable (localized)**: Indicates that the cancer can be surgically removed.
2. **Unresectable, metastatic, or recurrent**: Indicates that the cancer cannot be completely removed by surgery.

Staging is crucial because it directly influences prognosis, treatment options, and decisions regarding surgical interventions. The specific stages used for bile duct cancer are based on tumor characteristics and spread, contingent on diagnostic test results.",580,"What role does staging play in the diagnosis and treatment planning of bile duct cancer, and what does it involve?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of staging in the diagnosis and treatment planning of bile duct cancer, which is a core aspect of the original answer.

                    There are different types of treatment for children with Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating childhood cancer.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Medical oncologist /hematologist.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.    -  Child-life specialist.        The treatment of Hodgkin lymphoma in adolescents and young adults may be different than the treatment for children. Some adolescents and young adults are treated with an adult treatment regimen.
                
                
                    Children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Some cancer treatments cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after cancer treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Because late effects affect health and development, regular follow-up exams are important.   Late effects of cancer treatment may include:         - Physical problems that affect the following:               - Development of sex and reproductive organs.      -  Fertility (ability to have children).      - Bone and muscle growth and development.      -  Thyroid, heart, or lung function.      - Teeth, gums, and salivary gland function.      -  Spleen function (increased risk of infection).              - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).         For female survivors of Hodgkin lymphoma, there is an increased risk of breast cancer. This risk depends on the amount of radiation therapy they received to the breast during treatment and the chemotherapy regimen used. The risk of breast cancer is decreased if these female survivors also received radiation therapy to the ovaries.    It is suggested that female survivors who received radiation therapy to the breast have a mammogram once a year starting 8 years after treatment or at age 25 years, whichever is later. Female survivors of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer have an increased risk of dying from the disease compared to patients with no history of Hodgkin lymphoma who have breast cancer.   Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the risk group. For example, children with low-risk Hodgkin lymphoma receive fewer cycles of treatment, fewer anticancer drugs, and lower doses of anticancer drugs than children with high-risk lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           Radiation therapy may be given, based on the childs risk group and chemotherapy regimen. External radiation therapy is used to treat childhood Hodgkin lymphoma. The radiation is given only to the lymph nodes or other areas with cancer. Internal radiation therapy is not used to treat Hodgkin lymphoma.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy and proteasome inhibitor therapy are being used in the treatment of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     In children, rituximab may be used to treat refractory or recurrent Hodgkin lymphoma. Brentuximab, nivolumab, pembrolizumab, and atezolizumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied to treat children.    Proteasome inhibitor therapy is a type of targeted therapy that blocks the action of proteasomes (proteins that remove other proteins the body no longer needs) in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors. Bortezomib is a proteasome inhibitor used to treat refractory or recurrent childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.        Surgery     Surgery may be done to remove as much of the tumor as possible for localized nodular lymphocyte -predominant childhood Hodgkin lymphoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant      High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.    See Drugs Approved for Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Proton beam radiation therapy     Proton-beam therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged particles of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation therapy may help lessen the damage to healthy tissue near the tumor.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.

                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   For patients who receive chemotherapy alone, a PET scan may be done 3 weeks or more after treatment ends. For patients who receive radiation therapy last, a PET scan should not be done until 8 to 12 weeks after treatment.

For **low-risk classical childhood Hodgkin lymphoma**, the treatment may include:
- Combination chemotherapy with fewer cycles.
- Lower doses of anticancer drugs. 
- Radiation therapy may also be incorporated but typically targets only areas with cancer.

In contrast, for **high-risk classical childhood Hodgkin lymphoma**, the treatment may include:
- Higher dose combination chemotherapy, which involves a more intensive regimen.
- Additional radiation therapy to the areas with cancer.
- Participation in a clinical trial of targeted therapy combined with chemotherapy may also be considered.

These differences reflect the need for more aggressive treatment approaches in high-risk cases to account for the increased likelihood of treatment failure or cancer recurrence.",369,How do the treatment regimens differ between low-risk and high-risk classical childhood Hodgkin lymphoma cases?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the differences in treatment regimens for low-risk and high-risk classical childhood Hodgkin lymphoma as outlined in the original answer.

                    After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
                
                
                    The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma:
                    Small    The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.           Medium    The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.       Large    The tumor is:            - more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or     - at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.            Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.
                    Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems. The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed:         -  Iris.    -  Ciliary body and choroid.         If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris.       Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA, the tumor:                   - is in the iris only and is more than one fourth the size of the iris; or       - is in the iris only and has caused glaucoma; or       - has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both. The tumor has caused glaucoma.                - In stage IIB, the tumor has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both, and has also spread into the sclera. The tumor has caused glaucoma.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.            - In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick.     - In stage IIIB, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick.              Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread:            - to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid:
                    Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the tumor is. Category 1 tumors are the smallest and category 4 tumors are the biggest.   Category 1:         - The tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 9 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick.        Category 2:         - The tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick.        Category 3:         - The tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 3.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 9.1 to 12 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 12.1 to 15 millimeters thick.        Category 4:         - The tumor is more than 18 millimeters wide and may be any thickness; or    - the tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and more than 12 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 12.1 to 15 millimeters wide and more than 15 millimeters thick.          Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is size category 1 and is in the choroid only.       Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA, the tumor:                   - is size category 1 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 1 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 2 and is in the choroid only.                - In stage IIB, the tumor:                  - is size category 2 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and is in the choroid only.                         Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.            - In stage IIIA, the tumor:                  - is size category 2 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has not spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 4 and is in the choroid only.                - In stage IIIB, the tumor:                  - is size category 3 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball.

An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Sedimentation rate : A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the rate at which the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube. The sedimentation rate is a measure of how much inflammation is in the body. A higher than normal sedimentation rate may be a sign of lymphoma. Also called erythrocyte sedimentation rate, sed rate, or ESR.    -   Lymph node biopsy : The removal of all or part of a lymph node. The lymph node may be removed during an image-guided CT scan or a thoracoscopy, mediastinoscopy, or laparoscopy. One of the following types of biopsies may be done:                -  Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lymph node.       -  Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lymph node.      -  Core biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a wide needle.      -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy : The removal of tissue from a lymph node using a thin needle.          A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells, especially Reed-Sternberg cells. Reed-Sternberg cells are common in classical Hodgkin lymphoma. The following test may be done on tissue that was removed:               -  Immunophenotyping : A laboratory test used to identify cells, based on the types of antigens or markers on the surface of the cell. This test is used to diagnose the specific type of lymphoma by comparing the cancer cells to normal cells of the immune system.","In a Complete Blood Count (CBC) to aid in the diagnosis of childhood Hodgkin lymphoma, the following specific blood components are assessed:

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - Whether there are certain inherited gene changes.    - The age of the child.    - The amount of tumor remaining after surgery.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to the kidney at the time of diagnosis.,"The age of the child at diagnosis impacts the treatment options available for tumors such as Wilms tumor, rhabdoid tumor, clear cell sarcoma, and neuroblastoma. For Wilms tumor, prognosis and treatment options vary with the child's age, as younger children may have different treatment responses compared to older children. Similarly, the prognosis for rhabdoid tumors and clear cell sarcoma also depends on the age at diagnosis, influencing the specific treatment strategies that are considered appropriate. In neuroblastoma, the child's age is a key factor in determining risk groups and subsequent treatment approaches, as age can influence the aggressiveness of the disease and the effectiveness of certain treatments.

                    Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease. See the General Information section for more information.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor.            -  Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs.              Stage III     In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.        Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity. It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes.","Stage 0 pancreatic cancer, also known as carcinoma in situ, is characterized by the presence of abnormal cells in the lining of the pancreas that may become cancerous and spread to nearby normal tissue. In contrast, Stage I indicates that cancer has formed and is localized within the pancreas itself. Stage I is further divided into IA and IB based on tumor size—stage IA involves a tumor that is 2 centimeters or smaller, while stage IB involves a tumor larger than 2 centimeters. Therefore, the key distinction between Stage 0 and Stage I is that Stage 0 involves abnormal cells that have not yet formed a tumor, while Stage I represents the presence of a tumor within the pancreas.",676,What distinguishes Stage 0 from Stage I in pancreatic cancer progression?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately summarizes the differences between Stage 0 and Stage I pancreatic cancer as outlined in the original answer.

                    Two grouping systems are used for childhood liver cancer:         - The PRETEXT group describes the tumor before the patient has treatment.    - The POSTTEXT group describes the tumor after the patient has treatment.
                
                
                    There are four PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups:
                    The liver is divided into 4 sections. The PRETEXT and POSTTEXT groups depend on which sections of the liver have cancer.     PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group I     In group I, the cancer is found in one section of the liver. Three sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group II     In group II, cancer is found in one or two sections of the liver. Two sections of the liver that are next to each other do not have cancer in them.       PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group III     In group III, one of the following is true:            -  Cancer is found in three sections of the liver and one section does not have cancer.     - Cancer is found in two sections of the liver and two sections that are not next to each other do not have cancer in them.              PRETEXT and POSTTEXT Group IV     In group IV, cancer is found in all four sections of the liver.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if childhood liver cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually liver cancer cells. The disease is metastatic liver cancer, not lung cancer.","Childhood liver cancer can spread within the body through three primary mechanisms: tissue invasion, lymphatic spread, and hematogenous spread (via the bloodstream). 

1. **Tissue Invasion**: The cancer spreads from where it originated by directly growing into nearby tissues and organs. As the cancerous cells multiply, they can infiltrate surrounding areas in the liver and potentially extend into adjacent organs.

2. **Lymphatic Spread**: This occurs when cancer cells invade the lymphatic system. Once the cancer cells enter the lymphatic vessels, they can travel through the lymphatic pathways to reach and form tumors in other areas of the body, such as the lungs.

3. **Hematogenous Spread**: In this pathway, cancer cells gain access to the bloodstream. They can then circulate through the blood vessels and establish metastatic tumors in distant organs or tissues, similarly leading to the formation of secondary cancers in places like the lungs or other parts of the liver.

Each of these pathways facilitates metastasis, allowing childhood liver cancer to spread beyond its initial site, complicating treatment and potentially affecting prognosis.",611,"What are the mechanisms through which childhood liver cancer can spread within the body, and how does each pathway work?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about the mechanisms through which childhood liver cancer can spread, accurately summarizing the key pathways of spread: tissue invasion, lymphatic spread, and hematogenous spread.

"Age can affect the risk of plasma cell neoplasms. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.    Plasma cell neoplasms are most common in people who are middle aged or older. For multiple myeloma and plasmacytoma, other risk factors include the following:          - Being black.    - Being male.    - Having a personal history of MGUS or plasmacytoma.    - Being exposed to radiation or certain chemicals.","Individuals who believe they may have risk factors for plasma cell neoplasms, such as age or medical history, should talk with their doctor. It's important to have a conversation about potential risks, even though having a risk factor does not guarantee that one will develop cancer.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
				                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Vaccine therapy     Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy.
				                
				                
				                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
				                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
				                
				                
				                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
				                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials.

"Tests that examine the ovaries and pelvic area are used to detect (find) and diagnose ovarian, fallopian tube, and peritoneal cancer. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Pelvic exam : An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -   CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level can be a sign of cancer or another condition such as endometriosis.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs in the abdomen, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. Some patients may have a transvaginal ultrasound.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue is usually removed during surgery to remove the tumor.","The purpose of a transvaginal ultrasound in the context of detecting abnormalities in the pelvic region is to create detailed images of the internal structures, including the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. During this procedure, a transducer is inserted into the vagina, and high-energy sound waves are used to produce echoes, which form a picture of the body tissues known as a sonogram. This imaging technique can help identify tumors or other abnormalities within the pelvic area, thereby aiding in the diagnosis and staging of conditions such as uterine sarcoma or other gynecological disorders.",490,Can you explain the purpose of a transvaginal ultrasound in the context of detecting abnormalities in the pelvic region?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer focuses specifically on the purpose of a transvaginal ultrasound in detecting abnormalities in the pelvic region, which is a relevant aspect of the original answer.

                    After an extragonadal germ cell tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. For extragonadal germ cell tumors, prognostic groups are used instead of stages. The tumors are grouped according to how well the cancer is expected to respond to treatment. It is important to know the prognostic group in order to plan treatment.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of tumor as the primary tumor. For example, if an extragonadal germ cell tumor spreads to the lung, the tumor cells in the lung are actually cancerous germ cells. The disease is metastatic extragonadal germ cell tumor, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following prognostic groups are used for extragonadal germ cell tumors:
                    Good prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the levels of tumor markers AFP and -hCG are normal and LDH is slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the good prognosis group if:            - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Intermediate prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:             - the tumor is in the back of the abdomen; and     - the tumor has not spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is more than slightly above normal.           A seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the intermediate prognosis group if:            - the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; and     - the level of AFP is normal; -hCG and LDH may be at any level.              Poor prognosis    A nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor is in the poor prognosis group if:            - the tumor is in the chest; or     -  the tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs; or     - the level of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is high.            Seminoma extragonadal germ cell tumor does not have a poor prognosis group.","The prognostic group classifications for seminoma and nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumors differ in terms of metastasis and tumor marker levels as follows:

For **nonseminomas**:
- **Good prognosis**: The tumor must be located in the back of the abdomen without spread to organs other than the lungs, and tumor marker levels for AFP and -hCG must be normal, with LDH slightly above normal.
- **Intermediate prognosis**: Similar initial conditions as the good prognosis group, but at least one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH) is elevated above slightly above normal.
- **Poor prognosis**: This group includes tumors in the chest, tumors that have spread to organs other than the lungs, or elevated levels of any one of the tumor markers (AFP, -hCG, or LDH).

For **seminomas**:
- **Good prognosis**: The tumor has not spread beyond the lungs, and the level of AFP is normal. The levels of -hCG and LDH may be at any level.
- **Intermediate prognosis**: The tumor has spread to organs other than the lungs, but AFP remains normal while -hCG and LDH levels can vary. Seminomas do not have a poor prognosis group classification.

In summary, nonseminomas have three distinct prognostic groups based on tumor location and marker levels, including a poor prognosis group, whereas seminomas only have two groups with no category for poor prognosis based on these criteria.",21,What differentiates the prognostic group classifications for seminoma and nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumors concerning metastasis and tumor marker levels?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively summarizes and differentiates the prognostic group classifications for seminoma and nonseminoma extragonadal germ cell tumors, aligning closely with the detailed information provided in the original answer.

                    Thymoma and thymic carcinoma are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form on the outside surface of the thymus.
                    The thymus, a small organ that lies in the upper chest under the breastbone, is part of the lymph system. It makes white blood cells, called lymphocytes, that protect the body against infections.     There are different types of tumors of the thymus. Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare tumors of the cells that are on the outside surface of the thymus. The tumor cells in a thymoma look similar to the normal cells of the thymus, grow slowly, and rarely spread beyond the thymus. On the other hand, the tumor cells in a thymic carcinoma look very different from the normal cells of the thymus, grow more quickly, and have usually spread to other parts of the body when the cancer is found. Thymic carcinoma is more difficult to treat than thymoma.   For information on thymoma and thymic carcinoma in children, see the PDQ summary on Unusual Cancers of Childhood Treatment.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. Prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects part of the hypopharynx, involves the whole hypopharynx, or has spread to other places in the body). Hypopharyngeal cancer is usually detected in later stages because early signs and symptoms rarely occur.    - The patient's age, gender, and general health.     - The location of the cancer.    - Whether the patient smokes during radiation therapy.        Treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - Keeping the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normal as possible.    - The patient's general health.        Patients who have had hypopharyngeal cancer are at an increased risk of developing a second cancer in the head or neck. Frequent and careful follow-up is important.","When deciding on treatment options for hypopharyngeal cancer patients, a critical consideration is maintaining the patient's ability to talk, eat, and breathe as normally as possible. This is especially important given the anatomical location of the hypopharynx, where treatments such as surgery may affect these vital functions. 

The treatment options can vary based on the stage of the cancer as well as the necessity to preserve these functions. For instance, while laryngopharyngectomy (removal of the larynx and part of the pharynx) is a common procedure, it poses a significant risk to vocal and swallowing capabilities. In contrast, partial laryngopharyngectomy aims to remove less tissue and helps prevent the loss of voice, highlighting the need for treatment decisions that consider quality of life factors related to communication and nutrition. 

Overall, evaluation of treatment options must balance cancer control with the potential impact on essential functions, incorporating the patient's general health and specific needs into the decision-making process.",462,"How do the considerations for maintaining the ability to talk, eat, and breathe come into play when deciding on treatment options for hypopharyngeal cancer patients?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the considerations for maintaining the ability to talk, eat, and breathe in relation to treatment options for hypopharyngeal cancer, which aligns well with the original answer's focus on treatment decisions based on the stage of cancer and the patient's ability to function normally.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.   For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, treatment is carefully chosen to protect the baby. Treatment decisions are based on the mothers wishes, the stage of the non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and the age of the baby. The treatment plan may change as the signs and symptoms, cancer, and pregnancy change. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Patients with non-Hodgkin lymphoma should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating lymphomas.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a medical oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating cancer, or a hematologist, a doctor who specializes in treating blood cancers. The medical oncologist may refer you to other health care providers who have experience and are experts in treating adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Neurosurgeon.    -  Neurologist.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Endocrinologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    - Other oncology specialists.
                
                
                    Patients may develop late effects that appear months or years after their treatment for non-Hodgkin lymphoma.
                    Side effects from cancer treatment that begin during or after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Treatment with chemotherapy, radiation therapy, or stem cell transplant for non-Hodgkin lymphoma may increase the risk of late effects.    Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:          - Heart problems.    -  Infertility (inability to have children).    - Loss of bone density.    -  Neuropathy (nerve damage that causes numbness or trouble walking).    - A second cancer, such as:               -  Lung cancer.      - Brain cancer.      -  Kidney cancer.      -  Bladder cancer.      -  Melanoma.      -  Hodgkin lymphoma.      -  Myelodysplastic syndrome.      -  Acute myeloid leukemia.                 Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your doctor about the effects cancer treatment can have on you. Regular follow-up to check for late effects is important.
                
                
                    Nine types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            Total-body irradiation is a type of external radiation therapy that is given to the entire body. It may be given before a stem cell transplant.    The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma, and may also be used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.    For pregnant women with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, radiation therapy should be given after delivery, if possible, to avoid any risk to the baby. If treatment is needed right away, pregnant women may decide to continue the pregnancy and receive radiation therapy. However, lead used to shield the baby may not protect it from scattered radiation that could possibly cause cancer in the future.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using two or more anticancer drugs. Steroid drugs may be added, to lessen inflammation and lower the body's immune response.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.     Intrathecal chemotherapy may also be used in the treatment of lymphoma that first forms in the testicles or sinuses (hollow areas) around the nose, diffuse large B-cell lymphoma, Burkitt lymphoma, lymphoblastic lymphoma, and some aggressive T-cell lymphomas. It is given to lessen the chance that lymphoma cells will spread to the brain and spinal cord. This is called CNS prophylaxis.     In pregnant women, the baby is exposed to chemotherapy when the mother is treated, and some anticancer drugs cause birth defects. Because anticancer drugs are passed to the baby through the mother, both must be watched closely when chemotherapy is given.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer.     Immunomodulators are a type of immunotherapy. Lenalidomide is an immunomodulator used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy, proteasome inhibitor therapy, and kinase inhibitor therapy are types of targeted therapy used to treat adult non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a monoclonal antibody used to treat many types of non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Monoclonal antibodies that have been joined to radioactive material are called radiolabeled monoclonal antibodies. Yttrium Y 90-ibritumomab tiuxetan is an example of a radiolabeled monoclonal antibody. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion.     Proteasome inhibitor therapy blocks the action of proteasomes in cancer cells and may prevent the growth of tumors.    Kinase inhibitor therapy, such as idelalisib, blocks certain proteins, which may help keep lymphoma cells from growing and may kill them. It is used to treat indolent lymphoma. Ibrutinib, a type of Bruton's tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, is used to treat lymphoplasmacytic lymphoma and mantle cell lymphoma.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Plasmapheresis    If the blood becomes thick with extra antibody proteins and affects circulation, plasmapheresis is done to remove extra plasma and antibody proteins from the blood. In this procedure, blood is removed from the patient and sent through a machine that separates the plasma (the liquid part of the blood) from the blood cells. The patient's plasma contains the unneeded antibodies and is not returned to the patient. The normal blood cells are returned to the bloodstream along with donated plasma or a plasma replacement. Plasmapheresis does not keep new antibodies from forming.        Watchful waiting      Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.        Antibiotic therapy     Antibiotic therapy is a treatment that uses drugs to treat infections and cancer caused by bacteria and other microorganisms.    See Drugs Approved for Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma for more information.       Surgery     Surgery may be used to remove the lymphoma in certain patients with indolent or aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    The type of surgery used depends on where the lymphoma formed in the body:            - Local excision for certain patients with mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma, PTLD, and small bowel T-cell lymphoma.     -  Splenectomy for patients with marginal zone lymphoma of the spleen.           Patients who have a heart, lung, liver, kidney, or pancreas transplant usually need to take drugs to suppress their immune system for the rest of their lives. Long-term immunosuppression after an organ transplant can cause a certain type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma called post-transplant lymphoproliferative disorder (PLTD).    Small bowel surgery is often needed to diagnose celiac disease in adults who develop a type of T-cell lymphoma.       Stem cell transplant    Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and/or total-body irradiation and then replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient (autologous transplant) or a donor (allogeneic transplant) and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy and/or radiation therapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the bodys blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Vaccine therapy     Vaccine therapy is a type of biologic therapy. Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Vaccine therapy can also be a type of targeted therapy.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

						                    Treatment of aggressive non-Hodgkin lymphoma during pregnancy may include the following:         - Treatment given right away based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to increase the mother's chance of survival. Treatment may include combination chemotherapy and rituximab.    - Early delivery of the baby followed by treatment based on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.    - If in the first trimester of pregnancy, medical oncologists may advise ending the pregnancy so that treatment may begin. Treatment depends on the type of non-Hodgkin lymphoma.","For patients diagnosed with non-Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard treatment options include:

1. **Radiation Therapy**: Uses high-energy x-rays or other radiation types to kill cancer cells or prevent their growth. 
2. **Chemotherapy**: Involves drugs that stop cancer cell growth by killing the cells or stopping their division. This can be systemic (affecting the whole body) or regional (targeting specific areas).
3. **Immunotherapy**: Utilizes the body’s immune system to fight cancer.
4. **Targeted Therapy**: Attacks specific cancer cells while sparing normal cells, using drugs or other substances.
5. **Plasmapheresis**: Removes excess proteins from the blood if the blood becomes thick due to extra antibodies.
6. **Watchful Waiting**: Involves monitoring the patient's condition without immediate treatment until symptoms change.
7. **Antibiotic Therapy**: Treats infections and cancers caused by bacteria.
8. **Surgery**: May be employed to remove the lymphoma in specific cases.
9. **Stem Cell Transplant**: Replaces blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment.

In contrast, newer treatments being explored in clinical trials include:

- **Vaccine Therapy**: A type of biologic therapy that seeks to enhance the immune response against cancer.
- Various forms of **immunotherapies** that are not yet standard.

                    Once a pituitary tumor has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if it has spread within the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or to other parts of the body.
                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. There is no standard staging system for pituitary tumors. Once a pituitary tumor is found, tests are done to find out if the tumor has spread into the brain or to other parts of the body. The following test may be used:          -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).
                
                
                    Pituitary tumors are described in several ways.
                    Pituitary tumors are described by their size and grade, whether or not they make extra hormones, and whether the tumor has spread to other parts of the body.   The following sizes are used:         - Microadenoma: The tumor is smaller than 1 centimeter.    - Macroadenoma: The tumor is 1 centimeter or larger.        Most pituitary adenomas are microadenomas.    The grade of a pituitary tumor is based on how far it has grown into the surrounding area of the brain, including the sella (the bone at the base of the skull, where the pituitary gland sits).","To determine the spread of a pituitary tumor within the central nervous system or to other parts of the body, the following diagnostic tests may be employed:

"Symptoms of primary myelofibrosis include pain below the ribs on the left side and feeling very tired. Primary myelofibrosis often does not cause early signs or symptoms. It may be found during a routine blood test. Signs and symptoms may be caused by primary myelofibrosis or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         - Feeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.    - Feeling full sooner than normal when eating.    - Feeling very tired.    - Shortness of breath.    - Easy bruising or bleeding.    -  Petechiae (flat, red, pinpoint spots under the skin that are caused by bleeding).    -  Fever.    - Night sweats.    - Weight loss.","Pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side can be attributed to several conditions, and these symptoms can overlap with those associated with primary myelofibrosis. In primary myelofibrosis, specific symptoms may include:

1. **Feeling pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side**: This can be a direct symptom of primary myelofibrosis due to splenomegaly (enlargement of the spleen) as a compensatory mechanism for low blood cell production.
2. **Feeling full sooner than normal when eating**: This could also relate to spleen enlargement affecting the stomach's normal capacity.

However, similar symptoms could stem from other conditions, including:

- **Hairy Cell Leukemia**: This condition also presents with pain or fullness below the ribs, alongside other symptoms such as infections or easy bruising.
- **Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia (CML)**: CML can involve pain or a sense of fullness below the ribs on the left side, along with fever, night sweats, and fatigue.
- **Polycythemia Vera**: Symptoms include a similar feeling of pressure or fullness below the ribs, linked to increased blood cell production.

To differentiate these from symptoms specifically associated with primary myelofibrosis, the following considerations may help:

- **Evaluation of Other Symptoms**: If a patient exhibits symptoms such as easy bruising, night sweats, weight loss, or fever in addition to left-sided pain or fullness, this may indicate primary myelofibrosis.
- **Routine Blood Tests**: Since primary myelofibrosis often does not present early signs or symptoms, it may be discovered during a routine blood test, which can reveal abnormalities in blood cell counts.
- **Medical History and Physical Examination**: An in-depth medical assessment can help determine the presence of splenomegaly or other systemic symptoms that are distinctive for primary myelofibrosis.

Ultimately, patients experiencing these symptoms should consult healthcare professionals to conduct appropriate diagnostic evaluations to ascertain the underlying cause.",655,"What potential reasons could cause pain or a feeling of fullness below the ribs on the left side, and how can these be differentiated from symptoms specifically associated with primary myelofibrosis?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the symptoms associated with primary myelofibrosis and provides potential alternate causes for the pain or fullness below the ribs on the left side.

"Imaging studies and tests that examine the blood and urine are used to detect (find) and diagnose gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as hormones, released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. The blood sample is checked to see if it contains a hormone produced by carcinoid tumors. This test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome.     -   Tumor marker test : A procedure in which a sample of blood, urine, or tissue is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as chromogranin A, made by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Chromogranin A is a tumor marker. It has been linked to neuroendocrine tumors when found in increased levels in the body.     -  Twenty-four-hour urine test: A test in which urine is collected for 24 hours to measure the amounts of certain substances, such as 5-HIAA or serotonin (hormone). An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. This test is used to help diagnose carcinoid syndrome.    -  MIBG scan : A procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as carcinoid tumors. A very small amount of radioactive material called MIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Carcinoid tumors take up the radioactive material and are detected by a device that measures radiation.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells.    -   Endoscopic ultrasound (EUS): A procedure in which an endoscope is inserted into the body, usually through the mouth or rectum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. A probe at the end of the endoscope is used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs, such as the stomach, small intestine, colon, or rectum, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. This procedure is also called endosonography.     -   Upper endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and passed through the esophagus into the stomach. Sometimes the endoscope also is passed from the stomach into the small intestine. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of disease.     -   Colonoscopy : A procedure to look inside the rectum and colon for polyps, abnormal areas, or cancer. A colonoscope is inserted through the rectum into the colon. A colonoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove polyps or tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.    -   Capsule endoscopy : A procedure used to see all of the small intestine. The patient swallows a capsule that contains a tiny camera. As the capsule moves through the gastrointestinal tract, the camera takes pictures and sends them to a receiver worn on the outside of the body.     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. Tissue samples may be taken during endoscopy and colonoscopy.","The **twenty-four-hour urine test** for measuring serotonin levels is a diagnostic procedure used in the context of gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors. This test involves the collection of urine over a full day (24 hours) to measure the amounts of specific substances that may indicate disease activity, including serotonin.

### Procedure:
1. **Urine Collection**: The patient collects all urine produced over a 24-hour period in a provided container. Care must be taken to ensure that all urine is included, as missing any portion may affect the test results.
2. **Laboratory Analysis**: After the collection period, the urine is sent to a laboratory, where it is analyzed for various metabolites, especially 5-Hydroxyindoleacetic acid (5-HIAA), a byproduct of serotonin metabolism. Elevated levels of serotonin or its metabolites in the urine can suggest the presence of a carcinoid tumor.

### Significance:
- **Diagnosis of Carcinoid Syndrome**: The test helps in diagnosing carcinoid syndrome, which can occur if the carcinoid tumor releases serotonin or other hormones into the bloodstream, particularly when the tumor has metastasized to the liver.
- **Monitoring disease activity**: High serotonin levels can indicate the activity of the tumor, and monitoring these levels can help assess treatment efficacy over time.
- **Differentiation from other conditions**: As some symptoms of carcinoid tumors can mimic other gastrointestinal conditions, the 24-hour urine test provides valuable information that aids in differentiating carcinoid tumors from other disorders that may present similarly.

Overall, the twenty-four-hour urine test is crucial for evaluating patients suspected of having gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors and provides significant insights into the tumor's metabolic activity and potential effects on the patient's health.",76,Can you explain the procedure and significance of the twenty-four-hour urine test for measuring levels of serotonin in relation to carcinoid tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately discusses the twenty-four-hour urine test, its procedure, and significance in relation to gastrointestinal carcinoid tumors.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","Participating in a clinical trial for Oropharyngeal Cancer can offer several potential benefits for patients:

"Diagnostic tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood soft tissue sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   X-rays : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body onto film, making pictures of areas inside the body.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas of the body, such as the chest, abdomen, arms, or legs. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest or abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.
                         - If tests show there may be a soft tissue sarcoma, a biopsy is done. One of the following types of biopsies is usually used:          -   Core needle biopsy : The removal of tissue using a wide needle. This procedure may be guided using ultrasound, CT scan, or MRI.     -   Incisional biopsy : The removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue.     -   Excisional biopsy : The removal of an entire lump or area of tissue that doesnt look normal. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. An excisional biopsy may be used to completely remove smaller tumors that are near the surface of the skin. This type of biopsy is rarely used because cancer cells may remain after the biopsy. If cancer cells remain, the cancer may come back or it may spread to other parts of the body.  An MRI of the tumor is done before the excisional biopsy. This is done to show where the original tumor is and may be used to guide future surgery or radiation therapy.        The placement of needles or incisions for the biopsy can affect the success of later surgery to remove the tumor. If possible, the surgeon who will remove any tumor that is found should be involved in planning the biopsy.    In order to plan the best treatment, the sample of tissue removed during the biopsy must be large enough to find out the type of soft tissue sarcoma and do other laboratory tests. Tissue samples will be taken from the primary tumor, lymph nodes, and other areas that may have cancer cells. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells and to find out the type and grade of the tumor. The grade of a tumor depends on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the cells are dividing. High-grade and mid-grade tumors usually grow and spread more quickly than low-grade tumors.    Because soft tissue sarcoma can be hard to diagnose, the tissue sample should be checked by a pathologist who has experience in diagnosing soft tissue sarcoma.   One or more of the following laboratory tests may be done to study the tissue samples:         -   Molecular test : A laboratory test to check for certain genes, proteins, or other molecules in a sample of tissue, blood, or other body fluid. A molecular test may be done with other procedures, such as biopsies, to help diagnose some types of cancer. Molecular tests check for certain gene or chromosome changes that occur in some soft tissue sarcomas.    -   Reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RTPCR) test: A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are studied using chemicals to look for changes in the expression of certain genes. When genes are expressed they make specific proteins that are needed for the structure, function, and monitoring of the bodys tissues and organs. This test is done in order to identify the type of tumor.     -   Cytogenetic analysis : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of bone marrow, blood, amniotic fluid, tumor or other tissue is viewed under a microscope to look for changes in the chromosomes. Fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) is a type of cytogenetic analysis.    -   Immunocytochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens (markers) in a sample of cells. The antibody is usually linked to an enzyme or fluorescent dye that causes the cells that have that marker to become visible under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of soft tissue sarcoma.","When there is a suspicion of soft tissue sarcoma, the following types of biopsies can be performed:

1. **Incisional Biopsy**: This involves the removal of part of a lump or a sample of tissue. It helps in diagnosing the tumor while preserving more surrounding tissue.

2. **Core Needle Biopsy**: This method uses a wide needle to remove a sample of tissue. It may be guided by imaging techniques such as ultrasound, CT scans, or MRIs to improve accuracy.

3. **Excisional Biopsy**: This procedure involves the removal of the entire lump or an area of tissue that appears abnormal. While it can be helpful in diagnosing smaller tumors located near the surface, it is less commonly used because it might leave behind cancer cells, potentially leading to a recurrence.

These biopsy types differ primarily in the amount of tissue they remove and their purpose—ranging from sampling for diagnosis to potentially complete removal of the tumor. The choice of biopsy depends on factors like the size and location of the tumor, as well as the overall treatment plan.",505,"What are the different types of biopsies that can be performed when there is a suspicion of soft tissue sarcoma, and how do they differ from each other?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately details the different types of biopsies related to the diagnosis of soft tissue sarcoma as described in the original answer.

                    Extragonadal germ cell tumors form from developing sperm or egg cells that travel from the gonads to other parts of the body.
                    "" Extragonadal"" means outside of the gonads (sex organs). When cells that are meant to form sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries travel to other parts of the body, they may grow into extragonadal germ cell tumors. These tumors may begin to grow anywhere in the body but usually begin in organs such as the pineal gland in the brain, in the mediastinum (area between the lungs), or in the retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).     Extragonadal germ cell tumors can be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer). Benign extragonadal germ cell tumors are called benign teratomas. These are more common than malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors and often are very large.   Malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors are divided into two types, nonseminoma and seminoma. Nonseminomas tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas. They usually are large and cause signs and symptoms. If untreated, malignant extragonadal germ cell tumors may spread to the lungs, lymph nodes, bones, liver, or other parts of the body.   For information about germ cell tumors in the ovaries and testicles, see the following PDQ summaries:         -  Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment     -  Testicular Cancer Treatment","Imaging and blood tests are crucial in the diagnostic process for extragonadal germ cell tumors. They are utilized to detect and diagnose the tumors through various methods, including:

1. **Imaging Studies**: Techniques such as chest x-rays, CT scans, and PET scans enable the visualization of organs and tissues where tumors may be present. These imaging tests help in assessing the size and location of the tumors.

2. **Blood Tests**: Serum tumor marker tests are conducted to measure specific substances in the blood that are linked to germ cell tumors. The levels of tumor markers such as Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG), and Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) are indicative of the presence and type of tumor, assisting in differentiating between seminoma and nonseminoma.

By integrating data from both imaging and blood tests, clinicians can arrive at a reliable diagnosis of extragonadal germ cell tumors.",16,How are imaging and blood tests utilized in the diagnostic process for extragonadal germ cell tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the utilization of imaging and blood tests in the diagnostic process for extragonadal germ cell tumors, which is a key point mentioned in the original answer.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (whether it affects the inner lining of the rectum only, involves the whole rectum, or has spread to lymph nodes, nearby organs, or other places in the body).    - Whether the tumor has spread into or through the bowel wall.    - Where the cancer is found in the rectum.    - Whether the bowel is blocked or has a hole in it.    - Whether all of the tumor can be removed by surgery.    -  The patients general health.     - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).","The stage of rectal cancer significantly impacts both the prognosis and the treatment options available. 

1. **Prognosis**: The prognosis largely depends on the extent of disease spread, whether the cancer is confined to the rectum (as in Stage 0 and Stage I) or if it has spread to nearby organs or lymph nodes (as seen in Stage II and Stage III, and particularly Stage IV). This variation in spread influences the likelihood of successful treatment outcomes.

2. **Treatment Choices**: 
   - **Stage 0**: Treatment may involve simple polypectomy, local excision, or resection if the tumor is too large. 
   - **Stage I**: Options include local excision or resection, with or without the addition of radiation therapy and chemotherapy post-surgery.
   - **Stages II and III**: Standard treatment typically involves surgery, often combined with chemotherapy and radiation therapy before (neoadjuvant therapy) and/or after (adjuvant therapy) surgery. 
   - **Stage IV**: Treatment may include surgery with or without chemotherapy or radiation, systemic chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy, or palliative measures aimed at improving quality of life.

                    Tobacco use    Using tobacco is the most common cause of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. The risk of these cancers is about 5 to 10 times higher for current smokers than for people who have never smoked.    The use of all types of tobacco, including cigarettes, pipes, cigars, and smokeless tobacco (snuff and chewing tobacco) can cause cancer of the oral cavity and oropharynx. For cigarette smokers, the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of cigarettes smoked per day.       Alcohol use    Using alcohol is also an important risk factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed per day. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about twice as high in people who have 3 to 4 alcoholic drinks per day and 5 times higher in people who have 5 or more alcoholic drinks per day compared with those who don't drink alcohol.       Tobacco and alcohol use    The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is 2 to 3 times higher in people who use both tobacco and alcohol than it is in people who use only tobacco or only alcohol. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is about 35 times higher in people who smoke 2 or more packs of cigarettes per day and have more than 4 alcoholic drinks per day than it is in people who have never smoked cigarettes or consumed alcohol.        Betel quid or gutka chewing    Chewing betel quid or gutka (betel quid mixed with tobacco) has been shown to increase the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer. Betel quid contains areca nut, which is a cancer-causing substance. The risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer increases with how long and how often betel quid or gutka are chewed. The risk for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is higher when chewing gutka than when chewing betel quid alone. Betel quid and gutka chewing is common in many countries in South Asia and Southeast Asia, including China and India.        Personal history of head and neck cancer    A personal history of head and neck cancer increases the risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer.
                
                
                    The following is a risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer:
                    HPV infection    Being infected with certain types of HPV, especially HPV type 16, increases the risk of oropharyngeal cancer. HPV infection is spread mainly through sexual contact.     The risk of oropharyngeal cancer is about 15 times higher in people who have oral HPV 16 infection compared with people who do not have oral HPV 16 infection.
                
                
                    The following is a protective factor for oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer:
                    Quitting smoking    Studies have shown that when people stop smoking cigarettes, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer decreases by one half (50%) within 5 years. Within 20 years of quitting, their risk of oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer is the same as for a person who never smoked cigarettes.
                
                
                    It is not clear whether avoiding certain risk factors will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.
                    It has not been proven that stopping alcohol use will decrease the risk of oral cavity cancer or oropharyngeal cancer.    Getting an HPV vaccination greatly lessens the risk of oral HPV infection. It is not yet known whether getting an HPV vaccination at any age will decrease the risk of oropharyngeal cancer from HPV infection.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for oral cavity cancer prevention trials and oropharyngeal cancer prevention trials that are now accepting patients.","To reduce the risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers, individuals can consider making the following lifestyle changes:

1. **Quit Smoking**: Quitting smoking is one of the most effective protective factors, which can decrease the risk significantly. Studies have shown that the risk of these cancers decreases by 50% within 5 years of quitting and matches that of non-smokers within 20 years.

2. **Limit Alcohol Consumption**: Reducing alcohol use may help lower the risk, as the risk of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancer increases with the number of alcoholic drinks consumed.

3. **Avoid Combined Tobacco and Alcohol Use**: Using both tobacco and alcohol increases the risk of these cancers significantly more than using either substance alone.

4. **Avoid Chewing Betel Quid or Gutka**: Chewing betel quid or gutka, which contains tobacco and areca nut (a carcinogen), should be avoided as it increases the risk of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.

5. **Get Vaccinated for HPV**: Receiving the HPV vaccination can reduce the risk of HPV infection, particularly HPV type 16, which is a significant risk factor for oropharyngeal cancer.

6. **Maintain a Healthy Lifestyle**: Engaging in regular exercise, maintaining a healthy weight, and eating a balanced diet rich in fruits and vegetables may all contribute to lowering the risk of various cancers.

7. **Regular Check-ups**: Consulting with healthcare professionals for regular screenings and check-ups can help in early detection and risk assessment. 

By adopting these lifestyle changes, individuals can take proactive steps to reduce their risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.",213,What are some lifestyle changes that individuals can make to reduce their risk of developing oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely aligns with the original answer by summarizing key lifestyle changes that individuals can adopt to reduce the risk of oral cavity and oropharyngeal cancers.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with anal cancer.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with anal cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.      -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat anal cancer.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping the cells from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.        Surgery            -  Local resection: A surgical procedure in which the tumor is cut from the anus along with some of the healthy tissue around it. Local resection may be used if the cancer is small and has not spread. This procedure may save the sphincter muscles so the patient can still control bowel movements. Tumors that form in the lower part of the anus can often be removed with local resection.     -  Abdominoperineal resection: A surgical procedure in which the anus, the rectum, and part of the sigmoid colon are removed through an incision made in the abdomen. The doctor sews the end of the intestine to an opening, called a stoma, made in the surface of the abdomen so body waste can be collected in a disposable bag outside of the body. This is called a colostomy. Lymph nodes that contain cancer may also be removed during this operation.
                
                
                    Having the human immunodeficiency virus can affect treatment of anal cancer.
                    Cancer therapy can further damage the already weakened immune systems of patients who have the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). For this reason, patients who have anal cancer and HIV are usually treated with lower doses of anticancer drugs and radiation than patients who do not have HIV.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiosensitizers     Radiosensitizers are drugs that make tumor cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. Combining radiation therapy with radiosensitizers may kill more tumor cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called neutrophils. Neutrophils are infection -fighting blood cells that surround and destroy dead cells and foreign substances (such as bacteria). The spleen and liver may swell because of the extra neutrophils. Chronic neutrophilic leukemia may stay the same or it may progress quickly to acute leukemia.,"Chronic neutrophilic leukemia originates from blood stem cells when too many of these stem cells differentiate into neutrophils, a type of white blood cell known for fighting infections. The abnormal proliferation of neutrophils is primarily driven by the transformation of blood stem cells into an excessive number of neutrophils, leading to their accumulation in the blood and bone marrow. This overproduction can cause the spleen and liver to swell due to the high levels of neutrophils. Factors that may contribute to this abnormal proliferation could include genetic mutations, although the context does not specify particular mutations or environmental influences related to chronic neutrophilic leukemia.",537,"How does chronic neutrophilic leukemia originate from blood stem cells, and what factors contribute to the abnormal proliferation of neutrophils?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains how chronic neutrophilic leukemia originates from blood stem cells and correctly describes the overproduction of neutrophils.

                    - After oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.     - There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.    - Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.    - The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:         - Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)     - Stage I     - Stage II     - Stage III     - Stage IV
                
                
                    After oropharyngeal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the oropharynx or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose oropharyngeal cancer are often used to stage the disease.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if oropharyngeal cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually oropharyngeal cancer cells. The disease is metastatic oropharyngeal cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for oropharyngeal cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the oropharynx. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and is 2 centimeters or smaller and is found in the oropharynx only.       Stage II    In stage II, the cancer is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 4 centimeters and is found in the oropharynx only.        Stage III    In stage III, the cancer is either:            - 4 centimeters or smaller; cancer has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or     - larger than 4 centimeters or has spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing). Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller.              Stage IV     Stage IV is divided into stage IVA, IVB, and IVC:            - In stage IVA, cancer:                  - has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing. Cancer may have spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor and the lymph node is 3 centimeters or smaller; or       - has spread to one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor (the lymph node is larger than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters) or to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck (the lymph nodes are 6 centimeters or smaller), and one of the following is true:                           - tumor in the oropharynx is any size and may have spread to the epiglottis (the flap that covers the trachea during swallowing); or          -  tumor has spread to the larynx, front part of the roof of the mouth, lower jaw, or muscles that move the tongue or are used for chewing.                                 - In stage IVB, the tumor:                  - surrounds the carotid artery or has spread to the muscle that opens the jaw, the bone attached to the muscles that move the jaw, nasopharynx, or base of the skull. Cancer may have spread to one or more lymph nodes which can be any size; or       - may be any size and has spread to one or more lymph nodes that are larger than 6 centimeters.                - In stage IVC, the tumor may be any size and has spread beyond the oropharynx to other parts of the body, such as the lung, bone, or liver.","Stage IV of oropharyngeal cancer is categorized into three sub-stages: IVA, IVB, and IVC.

- **Stage IVA** is characterized by:
  - Cancer that has spread to structures such as the larynx, the front part of the roof of the mouth, the lower jaw, or the muscles used for chewing or tongue movement. It may involve one lymph node on the same side of the neck as the tumor, which is 3 centimeters or smaller; or
  - It may also involve larger lymph nodes (greater than 3 centimeters but not larger than 6 centimeters) or spread to more than one lymph node anywhere in the neck, with the tumor in the oropharynx being any size, potentially involving the epiglottis.

- **Stage IVB** indicates that:
  - The tumor surrounds the carotid artery or has metastasized to critical areas such as the muscle that opens the jaw, the bone associated with jaw muscles, the nasopharynx, or the base of the skull. It can involve one or more lymph nodes of any size; or it could be any tumor size with lymph nodes larger than 6 centimeters.

- **Stage IVC** refers to:
  - Cancer that has spread beyond the oropharynx to other parts of the body (metastasis), such as the lungs, bones, or liver. The size of the primary tumor can vary.

"Health history can affect the risk of testicular cancer.
	                    Anything that increases the chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Risk factors for testicular cancer include:          - Having had an undescended testicle.    - Having had abnormal development of the testicles.    - Having a personal history of testicular cancer.    - Having a family history of testicular cancer (especially in a father or brother).    - Being white.
	                
	                
	                    Treatment for testicular cancer can cause infertility.
	                    Certain treatments for testicular cancer can cause infertility that may be permanent. Patients who may wish to have children should consider sperm banking before having treatment. Sperm banking is the process of freezing sperm and storing it for later use.","Individuals addressing potential infertility due to treatment for testicular cancer should consider the following steps:

1. **Sperm Banking**: Before starting any cancer treatment, patients should explore the option of sperm banking, which involves the freezing and storing of sperm for future use. This is especially important for those who wish to have children in the future, as certain treatments can cause infertility that may be permanent.

2. **Consultation with Healthcare Providers**: Patients should discuss their concerns about fertility with their healthcare provider. This conversation can provide more information about the risks of infertility related to specific treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, or chemotherapy.

3. **Follow-Up Care**: After treatment, ongoing communication with healthcare providers about reproductive health and fertility options is crucial. This may include assessments to determine fertility status post-treatment.

Taking these precautions can help individuals better manage the risk of infertility associated with testicular cancer treatments.",585,What steps should individuals take to address potential infertility due to treatment for testicular cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about steps to manage potential infertility due to treatment for testicular cancer.

"Tests that examine the small intestine are used to detect (find), diagnose, and stage small intestine cancer.Procedures that make pictures of the small intestine and the area around it help diagnose small intestine cancer and show how far the cancer has spread. The process used to find out if cancer cells have spread within and around the small intestine is called staging.    In order to plan treatment, it is important to know the type of small intestine cancer and whether the tumor can be removed by surgery. Tests and procedures to detect, diagnose, and stage small intestine cancer are usually done at the same time. The following tests and procedures may be used:          -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign of liver disease that may be caused by small intestine cancer.    -   Endoscopy : A procedure to look at organs and tissues inside the body to check for abnormal areas. There are different types of endoscopy:               -  Upper endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum (first part of the small intestine, near the stomach). An endoscope is inserted through the mouth and into the esophagus, stomach, and duodenum. An endoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.      -  Capsule endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A capsule that is about the size of a large pill and contains a light and a tiny wireless camera is swallowed by the patient. The capsule travels through the digestive tract, including the small intestine, and sends many pictures of the inside of the digestive tract to a recorder that is worn around the waist or over the shoulder. The pictures are sent from the recorder to a computer and viewed by the doctor who checks for signs of cancer. The capsule passes out of the body during a bowel movement.      -  Double balloon endoscopy : A procedure to look at the inside of the small intestine. A special instrument made up of two tubes (one inside the other) is inserted through the mouth or rectum and into the small intestine. The inside tube (an endoscope with a light and lens for viewing) is moved through part of the small intestine and a balloon at the end of it is inflated to keep the endoscope in place. Next, the outer tube is moved through the small intestine to reach the end of the endoscope, and a balloon at the end of the outer tube is inflated to keep it in place. Then, the balloon at the end of the endoscope is deflated and the endoscope is moved through the next part of the small intestine. These steps are repeated many times as the tubes move through the small intestine. The doctor is able to see the inside of the small intestine through the endoscope and use a tool to remove samples of abnormal tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure may be done if the results of a capsule endoscopy are abnormal. This procedure is also called double balloon enteroscopy.             -   Laparotomy : A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs or lymph nodes are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope to check for signs of cancer. This may be done during an endoscopy or laparotomy. The sample is checked by a pathologist to see if it contains cancer cells.     -   Upper GI series with small bowel follow-through: A series of x-rays of the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. The patient drinks a liquid that contains barium (a silver-white metallic compound). The liquid coats the esophagus, stomach, and small bowel. X-rays are taken at different times as the barium travels through the upper GI tract and small bowel.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).","To stage small intestine cancer, various procedures are utilized that help in diagnosing the condition as well as determining the extent to which it has spread. The following tests and procedures contribute to staging and, subsequently, to treatment planning:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: A thorough examination and review of the patient's medical history are performed to check for general signs of health and any unusual symptoms.

2. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: Blood samples are analyzed to measure substances released by organs and tissues, which can indicate disease.

3. **Liver Function Tests**: Blood samples are checked specifically for substances released by the liver to identify potential liver disease caused by small intestine cancer.

4. **Endoscopy**:
   - **Upper Endoscopy**: This procedure allows for direct visual examination of the upper digestive tract, including the duodenum, and can involve tissue sampling for biopsy if abnormalities are found.
   - **Capsule Endoscopy**: A patient swallows a capsule with a camera to take pictures of the small intestine, helping to identify signs of cancer.
   - **Double Balloon Endoscopy**: A more invasive method allowing for deeper examination and biopsy of the small intestine if earlier tests indicate abnormalities.

5. **Laparotomy**: This surgical procedure involves making an incision in the abdomen to visually inspect for disease and can include tissue sampling.

6. **Biopsy**: Direct removal of tissue samples for microscopic analysis to check for cancer cells, often performed during an endoscopy or laparotomy.

7. **Upper GI Series with Small Bowel Follow-Through**: This involves a series of X-rays after the patient drinks a barium solution, allowing for visualization of the small intestine.

8. **CT Scan**: A detailed imaging procedure that helps identify the extent of cancer and any spread to surrounding organs.

9. **MRI**: Magnetic resonance imaging is used to create detailed images of the inside of the body, including the small intestine.

These diagnostic procedures are essential for staging small intestine cancer, indicating whether the tumor can be surgically removed, and informing the choice of treatment options such as surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation therapy.

"Signs of GTD include abnormal vaginal bleeding and a uterus that is larger than normal. These and other signs and symptoms may be caused by gestational trophoblastic disease or by other conditions. Check with your doctor if you have any of the following:         -  Vaginal bleeding not related to menstruation.    -  A uterus that is larger than expected during pregnancy.    - Pain or pressure in the pelvis.    - Severe nausea and vomiting during pregnancy.    - High blood pressure with headache and swelling of feet and hands early in the pregnancy.    - Vaginal bleeding that continues for longer than normal after delivery.    -  Fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and a fast or irregular heartbeat caused by anemia.        GTD sometimes causes an overactive thyroid. Signs and symptoms of an overactive thyroid include the following:         - Fast or irregular heartbeat.    - Shakiness.    - Sweating.    - Frequent bowel movements.    - Trouble sleeping.    - Feeling anxious or irritable.    - Weight loss.","Fatigue and shortness of breath can relate to anemia in the context of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD) because these symptoms are often caused by anemia, which may occur in patients with GTD. Anemia can arise when the body does not have enough healthy red blood cells to carry adequate oxygen to the body's tissues. In the case of GTD, complications such as abnormal vaginal bleeding may lead to significant blood loss, thereby increasing the risk of anemia. As a result, patients may experience fatigue, shortness of breath, dizziness, and a fast or irregular heartbeat due to the reduced oxygen supply to the body's organs and tissues.",356,How can the presence of fatigue and shortness of breath relate to anemia in the context of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately connects fatigue and shortness of breath to anemia within the context of Gestational Trophoblastic Disease (GTD).

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with extragonadal germ cell tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three types of standard treatment are used:
                    Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat seminoma.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly in the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.       Surgery    Patients who have benign tumors or tumor remaining after chemotherapy or radiation therapy may need to have surgery.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   After initial treatment for extragonadal germ cell tumors, blood levels of AFP and other tumor markers continue to be checked to find out how well the treatment is working.

                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery (removing the cancer in an operation) is the most common treatment for all stages of colon cancer. A doctor may remove the cancer using one of the following types of surgery:            -  Local excision: If the cancer is found at a very early stage, the doctor may remove it without cutting through the abdominal wall. Instead, the doctor may put a tube with a cutting tool through the rectum into the colon and cut the cancer out. This is called a local excision. If the cancer is found in a polyp (a small bulging area of tissue), the operation is called a polypectomy.     -  Resection of the colon with anastomosis: If the cancer is larger, the doctor will perform a partial colectomy (removing the cancer and a small amount of healthy tissue around it). The doctor may then perform an anastomosis (sewing the healthy parts of the colon together). The doctor will also usually remove lymph nodes near the colon and examine them under a microscope to see whether they contain cancer.     - Resection of the colon with colostomy: If the doctor is not able to sew the 2 ends of the colon back together, a stoma (an opening) is made on the outside of the body for waste to pass through. This procedure is called a colostomy. A bag is placed around the stoma to collect the waste. Sometimes the colostomy is needed only until the lower colon has healed, and then it can be reversed. If the doctor needs to remove the entire lower colon, however, the colostomy may be permanent.            Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiofrequency ablation      Radiofrequency ablation is the use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.       Cryosurgery     Cryosurgery is a treatment that uses an instrument to freeze and destroy abnormal tissue. This type of treatment is also called cryotherapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).      Chemoembolization of the hepatic artery may be used to treat cancer that has spread to the liver. This involves blocking the hepatic artery (the main artery that supplies blood to the liver) and injecting anticancer drugs between the blockage and the liver. The livers arteries then deliver the drugs throughout the liver. Only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body. The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on what is used to block the artery. The liver continues to receive some blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used as palliative therapy to relieve symptoms and improve quality of life.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Types of targeted therapies used in the treatment of colon cancer include the following:            -  Monoclonal antibodies: Monoclonal antibodies are made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.                  -  Bevacizumab and ramucirumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). This may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.       -  Cetuximab and panitumumab are types of monoclonal antibodies that bind to a protein called epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) on the surface of some types of cancer cells. This may stop cancer cells from growing and dividing.                -  Angiogenesis inhibitors: Angiogenesis inhibitors stop the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                   -  Ziv-aflibercept is a vascular endothelial growth factor trap that blocks an enzyme needed for the growth of new blood vessels in tumors.       -  Regorafenib is used to treat colorectal cancer that has spread to other parts of the body and has not gotten better with other treatment. It blocks the action of certain proteins, including vascular endothelial growth factor. This may help keep cancer cells from growing and may kill them. It may also prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.                      See Drugs Approved for Colon and Rectal Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

"Tests are used to screen for Wilms tumor.
                    Screening tests are done in children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor. These tests may help find cancer early and decrease the chance of dying from cancer.   In general, children with an increased risk of Wilms tumor should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are at least 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is usually used for screening. Small Wilms tumors may be found and removed before symptoms occur.    Children with Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia are also screened for liver and adrenal tumors that are linked to these genetic syndromes. A test to check the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) level in the blood and an ultrasound of the abdomen are done until the child is 4 years old. An ultrasound of the kidneys is done after the child is 4 years old. In children with certain gene changes, a different schedule for ultrasound of the abdomen may be used.   Children with aniridia and a certain gene change are screened for Wilms tumor every three months until they are 8 years old. An ultrasound test of the abdomen is used for screening.   Some children develop Wilms tumor in both kidneys. These often appear when Wilms tumor is first diagnosed, but Wilms tumor may also occur in the second kidney after the child is successfully treated for Wilms tumor in one kidney. Children with an increased risk of a second Wilms tumor in the other kidney should be screened for Wilms tumor every three months for up to eight years. An ultrasound test of the abdomen may be used for screening.
                
                
                    Tests that examine the kidney and the blood are used to detect (find) and diagnose Wilms tumor and other childhood kidney tumors.
                    The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Complete blood count (CBC): A procedure in which a sample of blood is drawn and checked for the following:               - The number of red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.      - The amount of hemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen) in the red blood cells.      - The portion of the blood sample made up of red blood cells.             -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease. This test is done to check how well the liver and kidneys are working.    -   Renal function test : A procedure in which blood or urine samples are checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood or urine by the kidneys. A higher or lower than normal amount of a substance can be a sign that the kidneys are not working as they should.    -   Urinalysis : A test to check the color of urine and its contents, such as sugar, protein, blood, and bacteria.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. An ultrasound of the abdomen is done to diagnose a kidney tumor.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye is injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -  MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium: A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -  X-ray: An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body, such as the chest and abdomen.    -   PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The decision of whether to do a biopsy is based on the following:                - The size of the tumor.      - The stage of the cancer.      - Whether cancer is in one or both kidneys.      - Whether imaging tests clearly show the cancer.      - Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.      - Whether the patient is in a clinical trial.         A biopsy may be done before any treatment is given, after chemotherapy to shrink the tumor, or after surgery to remove the tumor.","The alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test plays a role in the diagnostic process for Wilms tumor in children with certain genetic conditions by checking the level of this protein in the blood. This test is particularly relevant for children with genetic syndromes like Beckwith-Wiedemann syndrome or hemihyperplasia, as they are also screened for liver and adrenal tumors associated with these syndromes. The AFP test, along with an ultrasound of the abdomen, is performed until the child is 4 years old. After the age of 4, an ultrasound of the kidneys takes precedence for screening. 

In summary, the age guidelines for AFP testing in these children are until they reach 4 years old, after which kidney ultrasounds are conducted for ongoing screening.",469,"How does the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test function as part of the diagnostic process for Wilms tumor in children with certain genetic conditions, and what are the age guidelines for this testing?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear explanation of the alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) test's role in the diagnostic process for Wilms tumor, specifically mentioning its relevance for children with genetic conditions and detailing the age guidelines for testing.

"Imaging studies and tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood CNS germ cell tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patient's health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -  Visual field exam: An exam to check a persons field of vision (the total area in which objects can be seen). This test measures both central vision (how much a person can see when looking straight ahead) and peripheral vision (how much a person can see in all other directions while staring straight ahead). The eyes are tested one at a time. The eye not being tested is covered.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the brain and spinal cord. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs of tumor cells. The sample may also be checked for the amounts of protein and glucose. A higher than normal amount of protein or lower than normal amount of glucose may be a sign of a tumor. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.    -   Tumor marker tests : A procedure in which a sample of blood or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood and CSF by organs, tissues, or tumor cells in the body. Certain substances are linked to specific types of cancer when found in increased levels in the blood. These are called tumor markers. The following tumor markers are used to diagnose some CNS germ cell tumors:               -  Alpha-fetoprotein (AFP).      -  Beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).              -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -  Blood hormone studies: A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain hormones released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher- or lower-than-normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease in the organ or tissue that makes it. The blood will be checked for the levels of hormones made by the pituitary gland and other glands.
                    A biopsy may be done to be sure of the diagnosis of CNS germ cell tumor. If doctors think your child may have a CNS germ cell tumor, a biopsy may be done. For brain tumors, the biopsy is done by removing part of the skull and using a needle to remove a sample of tissue. Sometimes, a needle guided by a computer is used to remove the tissue sample. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are found, the doctor may remove as much tumor as safely possible during the same surgery. The piece of skull is usually put back in place after the procedure.    Sometimes the diagnosis can be made based on the results of imaging and tumor marker tests and a biopsy is not needed.     The following test may be done on the sample of tissue that is removed:         -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of brain tumors.","A lumbar puncture (also known as a spinal tap) plays a crucial role in the diagnosis of central nervous system (CNS) germ cell tumors by allowing doctors to collect cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) for analysis. During this procedure, a needle is inserted into the spinal canal to withdraw CSF, which can reveal specific abnormalities that suggest the presence of a CNS germ cell tumor.

Doctors typically look for the following specific abnormalities in the CSF:

1. **Tumor Markers**: Elevated levels of specific tumor markers such as alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (β-hCG) can indicate the presence of germ cell tumors. The presence of these markers in the CSF can help differentiate between types of CNS tumors and aid in confirming a diagnosis.

2. **Cellualar Changes**: The CSF may show abnormal cells or increased levels of certain immune cells, which can indicate infection or other pathological changes associated with the tumor.

Detecting these abnormalities in the CSF through lumbar puncture supports the diagnosis of CNS germ cell tumors and assists in determining the appropriate treatment strategy.",447,"Can you explain the role of a lumbar puncture in the diagnosis of CNS germ cell tumors, including what specific abnormalities doctors look for in the cerebrospinal fluid?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the role of a lumbar puncture in diagnosing CNS germ cell tumors, as it details how cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) is collected and what specific abnormalities, such as tumor markers and cellular changes, doctors look for in the analysis.

Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biological therapy.     Vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment.       Other drug therapy     Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor.

"Previous chemotherapy and exposure to radiation may increase the risk of developing ALL. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk. Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:         - Being male.    - Being white.    - Being older than 70.    - Past treatment with chemotherapy or radiation therapy.    - Being exposed to high levels of radiation in the environment (such as nuclear radiation).    - Having certain genetic disorders, such as Down syndrome.","Demographic factors such as age and gender significantly influence the risk of developing Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) in children. 

1. **Age**: 
   - Risk groups for childhood ALL are stratified by age. Children aged 1 to younger than 10 years are classified as standard (low) risk, while children who are 10 years and older are categorized as high risk. Additionally, children younger than age 1 can fall into the very high-risk group, indicating that younger age can relate to a more severe prognosis.

2. **Gender**: 
   - The context does not provide specific details on gender differences in the risk for developing ALL, but in general, male children are often found to have a higher incidence of various cancers, including leukemias compared to female children.

Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","The eligibility requirements for clinical trials vary for newly diagnosed patients versus those already undergoing treatment for gastrointestinal (GI) carcinoid tumors. 

1. **Newly Diagnosed Patients**: Some clinical trials are specifically designed for patients who have not yet received any treatment. These trials focus on testing new therapies or interventions from the outset, which may offer better outcomes than current standard treatments.

2. **Patients Undergoing Treatment**: Other trials may accept patients who are currently receiving treatment or have previously been treated. These trials can evaluate the efficacy of new treatments for those whose cancer has not improved, or for those aiming to stop cancer recurrence or mitigate treatment side effects.

In summary, while some clinical trials are explicitly open to newly diagnosed patients, others are available for those already in treatment, emphasizing the need for individualized assessment based on treatment history and specific trial criteria.",80,Could you explain the difference in eligibility for clinical trials that accept newly diagnosed patients versus those already undergoing treatment for GI carcinoid tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question about the difference in eligibility for clinical trials between newly diagnosed patients and those already undergoing treatment for GI carcinoid tumors.

"Tests are used to detect (find) and diagnose childhood vascular tumors. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps, lesions, or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.     -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. A biopsy is not always needed to diagnose a vascular tumor.","The physical exam and patient history play a crucial role in the evaluation of childhood vascular tumors. During the physical exam, healthcare providers check for general signs of health and look specifically for any unusual signs, such as lumps or lesions. This assessment helps identify the presence of vascular tumors. 

The patient's history involves gathering information about their health habits, past illnesses, and treatments. This background information can be vital in understanding the context of the tumor, including risk factors or syndromes associated with the child's condition. 

In the case of conditions like infantile hemangiomas, a detailed physical examination and history are frequently sufficient for diagnosis. However, if aspects of the tumor appear unusual, further diagnostic procedures such as ultrasound or MRI might be utilized. This combination of physical exams, patient history, and potential follow-up imaging assists in accurate diagnosis and appropriate treatment planning for childhood vascular tumors.",566,What role does a physical exam and patient history play in the evaluation of childhood vascular tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately details the role of physical exams and patient history in diagnosing childhood vascular tumors, closely aligning with the original answer's content.

"Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.     The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include exercising more or quitting smoking or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

                    Ovarian low malignant potential tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissue covering the ovary.
                    Ovarian low malignant potential tumors have abnormal cells that may become cancer, but usually do not. This disease usually remains in the ovary. When disease is found in one ovary, the other ovary should also be checked carefully for signs of disease.    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries make eggs and female hormones.","It is important to examine both ovaries when one is diagnosed with an ovarian low malignant potential tumor because the disease may remain localized in one ovary, and there is a possibility that the other ovary could also show signs of disease. When abnormal cells are found in one ovary, careful examination of the other ovary is necessary to ensure that any potential disease is detected early, as the ovaries are paired organs and disease could potentially develop or be present in both.",370,Why is it important to examine both ovaries when one is diagnosed with ovarian low malignant potential tumor?,RELEVANT,The generated answer addresses the importance of examining both ovaries when diagnosed with ovarian low malignant potential tumor. It accurately captures the need for careful examination due to the disease's potential to remain localized in one ovary and the risk of the other ovary also showing signs of disease. This aligns well with the key points mentioned in the original answer regarding the nature of the disease and the importance of detection.
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on:         - The type of lymphoma.    - Where the tumor is in the body when the tumor is diagnosed.    - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.    - The type of initial treatment.    - Whether the lymphoma responded to initial treatment.    - The patients age and general health.,"The initial treatment for children diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma can significantly affect their overall outlook, particularly in relation to their age and general health. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on several factors:

1. **Type of Initial Treatment**: The type of treatment provided initially plays a crucial role in the child's recovery chances.
  
2. **Response to Initial Treatment**: How well the lymphoma responds to the initial treatment is critical; a positive response can improve the outlook.

3. **Age and General Health**: The age of the child and their general health at the time of diagnosis significantly influence the prognosis. Children who are younger or in better overall health typically have a more favorable outlook compared to those who are older or have health issues.

4. **Other Factors**: Additional factors influencing prognosis include the type of lymphoma, the stage at which it is diagnosed, and specific characteristics of the lymphoma cells.

Overall, effective initial treatment correlates positively with recovery chances, especially when considering the child's age and health status along with their response to treatment.",429,"How does the initial treatment affect the overall outlook for children diagnosed with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma, especially in regards to their age and general health?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the original answer's points regarding the impact of initial treatment on prognosis for children with Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma. It incorporates relevant factors such as the type of initial treatment, response to treatment, and the influence of age and general health, aligning closely with the elements listed in the original answer."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer.    - The size of the tumor.    -  Whether there are B symptoms at diagnosis.    - The type of Hodgkin lymphoma.    - Certain features of the cancer cells.    - Whether there are too many white blood cells or too few red blood cells at the time of diagnosis.    - How well the tumor responds to initial treatment with chemotherapy.    - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred (come back).         The treatment options also depend on:         - The child's age and gender.    - The risk of long-term side effects.        Most children and adolescents with newly diagnosed Hodgkin lymphoma can be cured.,"Age and gender play significant roles in determining treatment decisions for children diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma. Specifically:

1. **Age**: 
   - The type of treatment can differ based on the child's age, with children and adolescents potentially receiving different regimens compared to older patients. This implies that the treatment plan is tailored to the developmental stage of the child, considering their specific medical needs.
   - Younger children may have distinct considerations regarding their growth, development, and potential long-term side effects from treatment.

2. **Gender**: 
   - Treatment options may also be influenced by the gender of the child, as certain late effects from treatments, such as risks associated with reproductive health, can vary between males and females. For instance, female survivors may face specific risks related to breast cancer depending on the treatment received.

Additionally, factors such as the risk of long-term side effects and the overall health of the child, combined with their age and gender, are crucial in determining the appropriate treatment strategy. Regular follow-ups are essential to monitor for these potential late effects, highlighting the importance of personalized care geared towards the child's unique circumstances.",366,In what ways do age and gender affect the treatment decisions for children diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about how age and gender affect treatment decisions for children with Hodgkin Lymphoma. It aligns well with the original answer by discussing how these factors influence treatment options, showing an understanding of the relevance of age and gender, as well as the individualization of treatment based on these aspects."

                    After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:                -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.      -  Lymph node dissection : A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for penile cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like warts are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. The tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer has spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb.     In stage IIIa, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.           In stage IIIb, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or      - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - to tissues near the penis such as the prostate, and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis; or      - to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread from the lymph nodes to the tissues around the lymph nodes; or     - to distant parts of the body.","The specific diagnostic tests typically performed during the staging process of penile cancer to determine the extent of the disease include:

1. **CT scan (CAT scan)**: This test creates detailed pictures of areas inside the body from different angles, often using a dye to enhance visibility.
2. **MRI (magnetic resonance imaging)**: This utilizes a magnet and radio waves to generate detailed images, with gadolinium injected to help highlight cancer cells.
3. **Ultrasound exam**: This method employs high-energy sound waves to create echoes that form images of internal organs and tissues.
4. **Chest x-ray**: An imaging test that produces pictures of the organs and bones inside the chest to check for any spread of cancer.
5. **Biopsy**: This involves the removal of cells or tissues for microscopic examination to detect cancer. This can be done through:
   - **Sentinel lymph node biopsy**: Removal of the first lymph node that receives drainage from the tumor to check for cancer spread.
   - **Lymph node dissection**: Removal of one or more lymph nodes for analysis to look for cancer signs.

"Unusual moles, exposure to sunlight, and health history can affect the risk of melanoma. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your doctor if you think you may be at risk.

                    There are different types of treatment for men with breast cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for men with breast cancer. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.   Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website. Choosing the most appropriate cancer treatment is a decision that ideally involves the patient, family, and health care team.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used to treat men with breast cancer:
                    Surgery      Surgery for men with breast cancer is usually a modified radical mastectomy (removal of the breast, many of the lymph nodes under the arm, the lining over the chest muscles, and sometimes part of the chest wall muscles).         Breast-conserving surgery, an operation to remove the cancer but not the breast itself, is also used for some men with breast cancer. A lumpectomy is done to remove the tumor (lump) and a small amount of normal tissue around it. Radiation therapy is given after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left.          Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.       Hormone therapy      Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.     See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat male breast cancer.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy used to treat men with breast cancer.     Monoclonal antibody therapy uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Monoclonal antibodies are also used with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy (treatment given after surgery to lower the risk that the cancer will come back).      Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2.     See Drugs Approved for Breast Cancer for more information.

		                    Initial Surgery
		                    Treatment for men diagnosed with breast cancer is usually modified radical mastectomy. Breast-conserving surgery with lumpectomy may be used for some men.
		                
		                
		                    Adjuvant Therapy
		                    Therapy given after an operation when cancer cells can no longer be seen is called adjuvant therapy. Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the operation, the patient may be given radiation therapy, chemotherapy, hormone therapy, and/or targeted therapy after surgery, to try to kill any cancer cells that may be left.         -  Node-negative: For men whose cancer is node-negative (cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy should be considered on the same basis as for a woman with breast cancer because there is no evidence that response to therapy is different for men and women.     -  Node-positive: For men whose cancer is node-positive (cancer has spread to the lymph nodes), adjuvant therapy may include the following:                - Chemotherapy plus tamoxifen (to block the effect of estrogen).      - Other hormone therapy.      - Targeted therapy with a monoclonal antibody (trastuzumab).                 These treatments appear to increase survival in men as they do in women. The patients response to hormone therapy depends on whether there are hormone receptors (proteins) in the tumor. Most breast cancers in men have these receptors. Hormone therapy is usually recommended for male breast cancer patients, but it can have many side effects, including hot flashes and impotence (the inability to have an erection adequate for sexual intercourse).
		                
		                
		                    Distant Metastases
		                    Treatment for men with distant metastases (cancer that has spread to other parts of the body) may be hormone therapy, chemotherapy, or both. Hormone therapy may include the following:         -  Orchiectomy (the removal of the testicles to decrease the amount of hormone made).    -  Luteinizing hormone-releasing hormone agonist with or without total androgen blockade (to decrease the the amount of sex hormones made).    -  Tamoxifen for cancer that is estrogen-receptor positive.    -  Progestin (a female hormone made in a laboratory).    -  Aromatase inhibitors (to decrease the amount of estrogen made).        Hormone therapies may be used in sequence (one after the other). Standard chemotherapy regimens may be used if hormone therapy does not work. Men usually respond to therapy in the same way as women who have breast cancer.","In the context of male breast cancer treatment, targeted therapy refers to a type of treatment that utilizes drugs or other substances to specifically identify and attack cancer cells while minimizing damage to normal cells. One significant component of targeted therapy is monoclonal antibody therapy, which involves the use of laboratory-made antibodies derived from a single type of immune system cell. 

Monoclonal antibodies, such as trastuzumab, play a crucial role in this approach by locating specific substances associated with cancer cells. Trastuzumab is a monoclonal antibody that blocks the effects of the growth factor protein HER2, which can stimulate cancer cell growth. When administered, these antibodies may attach to the cancer cells, leading to their destruction, inhibition of growth, or prevention of metastasis. Additionally, trastuzumab can be used in conjunction with chemotherapy as adjuvant therapy to boost treatment effectiveness after surgery by addressing any remaining cancer cells.",633,"What is targeted therapy in the context of male breast cancer treatment, and how do monoclonal antibodies like trastuzumab contribute to this therapeutic approach?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a clear and accurate description of targeted therapy in the context of male breast cancer treatment, aligning closely with the original answer.

Chronic neutrophilic leukemia is a disease in which too many blood stem cells become a type of white blood cell called neutrophils. Neutrophils are infection -fighting blood cells that surround and destroy dead cells and foreign substances (such as bacteria). The spleen and liver may swell because of the extra neutrophils.

                    After ovarian, fallopian tube, or peritoneal cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the ovaries or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out whether cancer has spread within the organ or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The results of the tests used to diagnose cancer are often also used to stage the disease. (See the General Information section.)
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if ovarian epithelial cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually ovarian epithelial cancer cells. The disease is metastatic ovarian epithelial cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer:
                    Stage I     In stage I, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes. Stage I is divided into stage IA, stage IB, and stage IC.            -  Stage IA: Cancer is found inside a single ovary or fallopian tube.     -  Stage IB: Cancer is found inside both ovaries or fallopian tubes.     -  Stage IC: Cancer is found inside one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and one of the following is true:                   - cancer is also found on the outside surface of one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes; or       - the capsule (outer covering) of the ovary ruptured (broke open) before or during surgery; or       - cancer cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity (the body cavity that contains most of the organs in the abdomen) or in washings of the peritoneum (tissue lining the peritoneal cavity).                         Stage II     In stage II, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes and has spread into other areas of the pelvis, or primary peritoneal cancer is found within the pelvis. Stage II ovarian epithelial and fallopian tube cancers are divided into stage IIA and stage IIB.            -  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread from where it first formed to the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes and/or the ovaries.     -  Stage IIB: Cancer has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to organs in the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs).               Stage III    In stage III, cancer is found in one or both ovaries or fallopian tubes, or is primary peritoneal cancer, and has spread outside the pelvis to other parts of the abdomen and/or to nearby lymph nodes. Stage III is divided into stage IIIA, stage IIIB, and stage IIIC.            - In stage IIIA, one of the following is true:                  - Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the area outside or behind the peritoneum only; or       - Cancer cells that can be seen only with a microscope have spread to the surface of the peritoneum outside the pelvis. Cancer may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.                 -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum.     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to the peritoneum outside the pelvis and the cancer in the peritoneum is larger than 2 centimeters. Cancer may have spread to lymph nodes behind the peritoneum or to the surface of the liver or spleen.              Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the abdomen to other parts of the body. Stage IV is divided into stage IVA and stage IVB.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer cells are found in extra fluid that builds up around the lungs.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to organs and tissues outside the abdomen, including lymph nodes in the groin.
                
                
                    Ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are grouped for treatment as early or advanced cancer.
                    Stage I ovarian epithelial and fallopian tube cancers are treated as early cancers.   Stages II, III, and IV ovarian epithelial, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are treated as advanced cancers.","In stage II ovarian or fallopian tube cancer, the cancer may spread beyond the ovaries or fallopian tubes into specific areas within the pelvis. This spread can be categorized into two sub-stages:

- **Stage IIA**: The cancer has spread to the uterus and/or the fallopian tubes in addition to the ovaries.
- **Stage IIB**: The cancer has spread from the ovary or fallopian tube to other organs within the peritoneal cavity, which is the space that contains the abdominal organs.

These classifications are significant in determining the extent of disease and planning appropriate treatment strategies.",492,"In stage II ovarian or fallopian tube cancer, what specific areas might the cancer spread to, and how does this affect the classification into stages IIA and IIB?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the specific areas that stage II ovarian or fallopian tube cancer may spread to, including details about stages IIA and IIB, which aligns with the original answer that discusses the same sub-stages and their implications for treatment classification.

                    - Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.     - There is no standard staging system for adult AML.
                
                
                    Once adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if the cancer has spread to other parts of the body.
                    The extent or spread of cancer is usually described as stages. In adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML), the subtype of AML and whether the leukemia has spread outside the blood and bone marrow are used instead of the stage to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used to determine if the leukemia has spread:         -   Lumbar puncture : A procedure used to collect a sample of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the spinal column. This is done by placing a needle between two bones in the spine and into the CSF around the spinal cord and removing a sample of the fluid. The sample of CSF is checked under a microscope for signs that leukemia cells have spread to the brain and spinal cord. This procedure is also called an LP or spinal tap.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of the abdomen, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.
                
                
                    There is no standard staging system for adult AML.
                    The disease is described as untreated, in remission, or recurrent.    Untreated adult AML    In untreated adult AML, the disease is newly diagnosed. It has not been treated except to relieve signs and symptoms such as fever, bleeding, or pain, and the following are true:         - The complete blood count is abnormal.    - At least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).    - There are signs or symptoms of leukemia.         Adult AML in remission    In adult AML in remission, the disease has been treated and the following are true:         - The complete blood count is normal.    - Less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow are blasts (leukemia cells).    - There are no signs or symptoms of leukemia in the brain and spinal cord or elsewhere in the body.         Recurrent Adult AML     Recurrent AML is cancer that has recurred (come back) after it has been treated. The AML may come back in the blood or bone marrow.","Untreated, in remission, and recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia (AML) represent different states of the disease:

1. **Untreated Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia**: This refers to AML that has just been diagnosed and has not received any treatment other than possibly managing symptoms. In this state, the complete blood count is abnormal, with at least 20% of the cells in the bone marrow being leukemia cells (blasts). Patients may exhibit signs or symptoms of leukemia.

2. **Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia in Remission**: In this phase, the AML has been treated, and the goal has been achieved, which is to eliminate the signs of the disease. For a patient to be considered in remission, the complete blood count is normal, with less than 5% of the cells in the bone marrow being blasts, and there are no detectable signs or symptoms of leukemia in the body.

3. **Recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia**: This is the state where AML has returned after a period of remission. The recurrence can happen in the blood or bone marrow, indicating that the treatment has failed to completely eliminate the leukemia cells, allowing them to regrow.

These stages significantly influence treatment options and the overall management of the disease.",684,"Can you explain the difference between untreated, in remission, and recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the differences between untreated, in remission, and recurrent Adult Acute Myeloid Leukemia, closely aligning with the information in the original answer.

"The signs and symptoms of atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor are not the same in every patient. Signs and symptoms depend on the following:         - The child's age.    - Where the tumor has formed.        Because atypical teratoid/rhabdoid tumor is fast growing, signs and symptoms may develop quickly and get worse over a period of days or weeks.

"Tests that examine the uterus are used to detect (find) and diagnose uterine sarcoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -  Pelvic exam: An exam of the vagina, cervix, uterus, fallopian tubes, ovaries, and rectum. A speculum is inserted into the vagina and the doctor or nurse looks at the vagina and cervix for signs of disease. A Pap test of the cervix is usually done. The doctor or nurse also inserts one or two lubricated, gloved fingers of one hand into the vagina and places the other hand over the lower abdomen to feel the size, shape, and position of the uterus and ovaries. The doctor or nurse also inserts a lubricated, gloved finger into the rectum to feel for lumps or abnormal areas.    -  Pap test: A procedure to collect cells from the surface of the cervix and vagina. A piece of cotton, a brush, or a small wooden stick is used to gently scrape cells from the cervix and vagina. The cells are viewed under a microscope to find out if they are abnormal. This procedure is also called a Pap smear. Because uterine sarcoma begins inside the uterus, this cancer may not show up on the Pap test.     -   Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.     -   Dilatation and curettage : A procedure to remove samples of tissue from the inner lining of the uterus. The cervix is dilated and a curette (spoon-shaped instrument) is inserted into the uterus to remove tissue. The tissue samples are checked under a microscope for signs of disease. This procedure is also called a D&C.    -   Endometrial biopsy : The removal of tissue from the endometrium (inner lining of the uterus) by inserting a thin, flexible tube through the cervix and into the uterus. The tube is used to gently scrape a small amount of tissue from the endometrium and then remove the tissue samples. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.","A transvaginal ultrasound works to detect tumors in the uterus by using a procedure where an ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina. This probe emits high-energy sound waves that bounce off internal tissues or organs, creating echoes. These echoes are then converted into images called sonograms, which provide a visual representation of the body tissues. Doctors can identify tumors by analyzing these sonograms produced during the examination.",11,"How does a transvaginal ultrasound work to detect tumors in the uterus, and what kind of images does it produce?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes how a transvaginal ultrasound works, aligning closely with the details provided in the original answer.

"Tests that examine many different body tissues and fluids are used to detect (find) and diagnose neuroblastoma. The following tests and procedures may be used:         -   Physical exam and history : An exam of the body to check general signs of health, including checking for signs of disease, such as lumps or anything else that seems unusual. A history of the patients health habits and past illnesses and treatments will also be taken.    -   Neurological exam : A series of questions and tests to check the brain, spinal cord, and nerve function. The exam checks a persons mental status, coordination, and ability to walk normally, and how well the muscles, senses, and reflexes work. This may also be called a neuro exam or a neurologic exam.    -   Urine catecholamine studies: A procedure in which a urine sample is checked to measure the amount of certain substances, vanillylmandelic acid (VMA) and homovanillic acid (HVA), that are made when catecholamines break down and are released into the urine. A higher than normal amount of VMA or HVA can be a sign of neuroblastoma.    -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   X-ray : An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) with gadolinium : A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   mIBG (metaiodobenzylguanidine) scan : A procedure used to find neuroendocrine tumors, such as neuroblastoma. A very small amount of a substance called radioactive mIBG is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. Neuroendocrine tumor cells take up the radioactive mIBG and are detected by a scanner. Scans may be taken over 1-3 days. An iodine solution may be given before or during the test to keep the thyroid gland from absorbing too much of the mIBG. This test is also used to find out how well the tumor is responding to treatment. mIBG is used in high doses to treat neuroblastoma.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.    -  Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The picture can be printed to be looked at later. An ultrasound exam is not done if a CT/MRI has been done.","A neurological exam assesses a patient's nerve function through a series of questions and tests focused on the brain, spinal cord, and nerve activity.

"Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are done with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are done with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent oral cavity cancer and oropharyngeal cancer are being studied in clinical trials.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) is affected by certain factors before and after treatment.    The prognosis of untreated osteosarcoma and MFH depends on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the body and whether tumors formed in more than one bone.    - The size of the tumor.    - Whether the cancer has spread to other parts of the body and where it has spread.    - The type of tumor (based on how the cancer cells look under a microscope).    - The patient's age and weight at diagnosis.    - Whether the tumor has caused a break in the bone.     - Whether the patient has certain genetic diseases.        After osteosarcoma or MFH is treated, prognosis also depends on the following:         - How much of the cancer was killed by chemotherapy.    - How much of the tumor was taken out by surgery.    - Whether chemotherapy is delayed for more than 3 weeks after surgery takes place.    - Whether the cancer has recurred (come back) within 2 years of diagnosis.        Treatment options for osteosarcoma and MFH depend on the following:         - Where the tumor is in the body.    - The size of the tumor.    - The stage of the cancer.    - Whether the bones are still growing.    - The patient's age and general health.    - The desire of the patient and family for the patient to be able to participate in activities such as sports or have a certain appearance.    - Whether the cancer is newly diagnosed or has recurred after treatment.","The age and weight of a patient at diagnosis significantly impact their chance of recovery from osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. Specifically:

1. **Age**: Younger patients generally have a better prognosis. This is relevant in cancer treatment and outcomes, as younger patients often respond more positively to therapies and may have greater overall health, which can contribute to recovery.

2. **Weight**: The patient's weight at diagnosis can also influence recovery chances. A healthy weight might suggest better overall health and nutritional status, which can play a role in the body's ability to tolerate treatment and recover more effectively after therapy.

In summary, both age and weight are critical factors that can affect the prognosis and treatment options for osteosarcoma and MFH, with younger age and appropriate weight being associated with more favorable outcomes.",92,In what ways do the age and weight of a patient at diagnosis impact their chance of recovery from these cancers?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses how age and weight at diagnosis impact the prognosis for osteosarcoma and MFH, which aligns with the details provided in the original answer. It emphasizes the importance of these factors in recovery chances and mentions related considerations, thus maintaining a strong connection to the original content."
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The type of ovarian cancer and how much cancer there is.    - The stage and grade of the cancer.    - Whether the patient has extra fluid in the abdomen that causes swelling.    - Whether all of the tumor can be removed by surgery.    - Whether there are changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes.    - The patients age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).,"The presence of extra abdominal fluid in patients with fallopian tube cancer often indicates a more advanced stage of the disease. According to the context provided, having extra fluid can affect the prognosis by suggesting that the cancer has spread beyond the ovaries or fallopian tubes, which generally correlates with a poorer outlook. Specifically, when cancer cells are found in the fluid of the peritoneal cavity, it may categorize the cancer as stage IC, which is associated with a more advanced presence of the disease and can lead to more complicated treatment options and a decreased chance of recovery. Therefore, the presence of extra abdominal fluid is a significant factor in determining prognosis for these patients.",491,How does the presence of extra abdominal fluid influence the prognosis for patients with fallopian tube cancer?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer focuses specifically on the influence of extra abdominal fluid on the prognosis of patients with fallopian tube cancer, which is a subset of the broader context provided in the original answer about ovarian cancer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Active surveillance     Active surveillance is closely watching a patients condition but not giving any treatment unless there are changes in test results that show the condition is getting worse. Active surveillance may be used to avoid or delay the need for treatments such as radiation therapy or surgery, which can cause side effects or other problems. During active surveillance, certain exams and tests are done on a regular schedule. Active surveillance may be used for very slow-growing tumors that do not cause symptoms.       Surgery     Surgery may be used to diagnose and treat adult brain and spinal cord tumors. Removing tumor tissue helps decrease pressure of the tumor on nearby parts of the brain. See the General Information section of this summary.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Radiation therapy    Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.  Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Conformal radiation therapy: Conformal radiation therapy is a type of external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the tumor and shapes the radiation beams to fit the tumor.       -  Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT): IMRT is a type of 3-dimensional (3-D) external radiation therapy that uses a computer to make pictures of the size and shape of the tumor. Thin beams of radiation of different intensities (strengths) are aimed at the tumor from many angles.       -  Stereotactic radiosurgery: Stereotactic radiosurgery is a type of external radiation therapy. A rigid head frame is attached to the skull to keep the head still during the radiation treatment. A machine aims a single large dose of radiation directly at the tumor. This procedure does not involve surgery. It is also called stereotaxic radiosurgery, radiosurgery, and radiation surgery.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain or spinal cord. External radiation therapy is used to treat adult central nervous system tumors.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug. To treat brain tumors, a wafer that dissolves may be used to deliver an anticancer drug directly to the brain tumor site after the tumor has been removed by surgery. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and grade of tumor and where it is in the brain.    Anticancer drugs given by mouth or vein to treat brain and spinal cord tumors cannot cross the blood-brain barrier and enter the fluid that surrounds the brain and spinal cord. Instead, an anticancer drug is injected into the fluid-filled space to kill cancer cells there. This is called intrathecal chemotherapy.    See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information.       Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.    Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that binds to a protein called vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and may prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. Bevacizumab is used in the treatment of recurrent glioblastoma.   Other types of targeted therapies are being studied for adult brain tumors, including tyrosine kinase inhibitors and new VEGF inhibitors.   See Drugs Approved for Brain Tumors for more information.
                
                
                    Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment.
                    This therapy controls problems or side effects caused by the disease or its treatment and improves quality of life. For brain tumors, supportive care includes drugs to control seizures and fluid buildup or swelling in the brain.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section refers to new treatments being studied in clinical trials, but it may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Proton beam radiation therapy     Proton beam radiation therapy is a type of high-energy, external radiation therapy that uses streams of protons (small, positively-charged pieces of matter) to make radiation. This type of radiation kills tumor cells with little damage to nearby tissues. It is used to treat cancers of the head, neck, and spine and organs such as the brain, eye, lung, and prostate. Proton beam radiation is different from x-ray radiation.        Biologic therapy     Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.    Biologic therapy is being studied for the treatment of some types of brain tumors. Treatments may include the following:            -  Dendritic cell vaccine therapy.     -  Gene therapy.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.   The following tests and procedures may be used to check whether a brain tumor has come back after treatment:         -   SPECT scan (single photon emission computed tomography scan): A procedure that uses a special camera linked to a computer to make a 3-dimensional (3-D) picture of the brain. A very small amount of a radioactive substance is injected into a vein or inhaled through the nose. As the substance travels through the blood, the camera rotates around the head and takes pictures of the brain. Blood flow and metabolism are higher than normal in areas where cancer cells are growing. These areas will show up brighter in the picture. This procedure may be done just before or after a CT scan.     -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the brain. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.

1. **External Radiation Therapy**: This is the most common form used to treat brain tumors. It involves using a machine outside the body to send high-energy x-rays to the tumor. External radiation therapy is primarily utilized for treating childhood brain and spinal cord tumors, as it allows for precise targeting of the affected areas.

2. **Internal Radiation Therapy**: Also known as brachytherapy, this method uses a radioactive substance that is sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters, which are then placed directly into or near the tumor. While this type is also a viable option for various cancers, external radiation is typically favored for brain tumors due to the complexity and sensitivity of the brain's anatomy.

In comparison, external radiation therapy is favored for its ability to treat larger areas and is often utilized in pediatric cases where precise targeting is critical due to the potential for surrounding healthy tissue damage. Internal radiation therapy may be considered in specific cases where tumors are not accessible by surgery or when a more localized treatment is required.

Overall, both types of radiation therapy aim to kill cancer cells or halt their growth, but the choice of which to use often depends on the specific characteristics of the tumor and the patient's overall treatment plan.",319,Can you explain the different types of radiation therapy available for treating brain tumors and how they compare to each other?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively outlines the two main types of radiation therapy for brain tumors—external and internal radiation therapy—while providing relevant details about their usage and characteristics.

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may have the opportunity to receive new treatments that are not yet available through standard care. Clinical trials often test innovative therapies that could be more effective than current options.

2. **Contribution to Research**: By joining a clinical trial, patients contribute to cancer research, helping to improve treatment approaches for future patients with GTD. Even when new treatments do not succeed, they often provide valuable data that advances understanding of the disease.

3. **Standard Care Options**: Some trials allow patients to receive standard treatments alongside experimental therapies, which can be beneficial for their health.

4. **Tailored Treatment**: Clinical trials can provide tailored treatment plans that are designed for specific types of GTD or for patients with particular characteristics, potentially leading to better outcomes.

5. **Close Monitoring**: Participants in clinical trials often receive closer monitoring and management from healthcare professionals, which may enhance their overall care and support during treatment.

6. **Eligibility for Innovative Strategies**: Some clinical trials focus on novel strategies for stopping cancer recurrence or reducing treatment side effects, offering additional options for patient care.

                    After penile cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the penis or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the penis or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. A substance called gadolinium is injected into a vein. The gadolinium collects around the cancer cells so they show up brighter in the picture. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The tissue sample is removed during one of the following procedures:                -  Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.      -  Lymph node dissection : A procedure to remove one or more lymph nodes during surgery. A sample of tissue is checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. This procedure is also called a lymphadenectomy.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if penile cancer spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually penile cancer cells. The disease is metastatic penile cancer, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for penile cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells or growths that look like warts are found on the surface of the skin of the penis. These abnormal cells or growths may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.       Stage I    In stage I, cancer has formed and spread to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Cancer has not spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels. The tumor cells look a lot like normal cells under a microscope.       Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer has spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stage IIIa and stage IIIb.     In stage IIIa, cancer has spread to one lymph node in the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or     - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.           In stage IIIb, cancer has spread to more than one lymph node on one side of the groin or to lymph nodes on both sides of the groin. Cancer has also spread:            - to connective tissue just under the skin of the penis. Also, cancer may have spread to lymph vessels or blood vessels or the tumor cells may look very different from normal cells under a microscope; or      - through connective tissue to erectile tissue (spongy tissue that fills with blood to make an erection); or     - beyond erectile tissue to the urethra.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - to tissues near the penis such as the prostate, and may have spread to lymph nodes in the groin or pelvis; or      - to one or more lymph nodes in the pelvis, or cancer has spread from the lymph nodes to the tissues around the lymph nodes; or     - to distant parts of the body.","The cancer staging process is crucial for determining treatment plans for patients diagnosed with penile cancer. Staging helps in understanding how far the cancer has spread, which directly influences the types of treatments that are appropriate for the patient.

1. **Identification of Cancer Stage**: The staging process involves tests such as CT scans, MRIs, ultrasounds, and biopsies to determine the extent of cancer spread within the penis or to other body parts. For penile cancer, the stages range from Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ) to Stage IV, with each stage indicating a different level of progression.

2. **Treatment Options Based on Stage**:
   - **Stage 0**: Treatments may include Mohs microsurgery, topical chemotherapy, or biological therapy. These options are less invasive and are targeted towards localized disease.
   - **Stage I**: Treatment typically includes surgical options like wide local excision or circumcision and may also involve radiation therapy. This reflects a slightly more advanced disease that can still be managed with relatively localized treatments.
   - **Stage II**: More aggressive surgical interventions (like penectomy) may be warranted, alongside possible radiation therapy. The cancer's spread to nearby tissues bay necessitate a more comprehensive approach.
   - **Stage III**: Treatment frequently involves surgery combined with additional therapies such as radiation or chemotherapy, reflecting further spread to lymph nodes or deeper tissues.
   - **Stage IV**: The treatment focus often shifts to palliative care, although surgery and radiation may be used to relieve symptoms. The advanced stage indicates a higher complexity in treatment due to widespread disease.

3. **Follow-up and Clinical Trials**: As treatment plans are influenced by staging, follow-up tests are essential to assess the effectiveness of the chosen treatment. Additionally, patients may consider clinical trials for novel treatments, especially at advanced stages where standard options may be limited.

Overall, the staging process is foundational in tailoring treatment plans that suit the specific circumstances of each patient's disease, enabling healthcare providers to apply the most effective interventions based on the cancer's progression.",61,Can you explain how the cancer staging process impacts treatment plans for patients diagnosed with penile cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer provides a comprehensive overview of the cancer staging process and its direct impact on treatment plans for penile cancer, which aligns closely with key points from the original answer.

The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.    -   CA 125 assay : A test that measures the level of CA 125 in the blood. CA 125 is a substance released by cells into the bloodstream. An increased CA 125 level is sometimes a sign of cancer or other condition.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   Transvaginal ultrasound exam: A procedure used to examine the vagina, uterus, fallopian tubes, and bladder. An ultrasound transducer (probe) is inserted into the vagina and used to bounce high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram. The doctor can identify tumors by looking at the sonogram.     -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the abdomen and pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues to show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Cystoscopy : A procedure to look inside the bladder and urethra to check for abnormal areas. A cystoscope is inserted through the urethra into the bladder. A cystoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.
                
                
                    Uterine sarcoma may be diagnosed, staged, and treated in the same surgery.
                    Surgery is used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma. During this surgery, the doctor removes as much of the cancer as possible. The following procedures may be used to diagnose, stage, and treat uterine sarcoma:         -  Laparotomy: A surgical procedure in which an incision (cut) is made in the wall of the abdomen to check the inside of the abdomen for signs of disease. The size of the incision depends on the reason the laparotomy is being done. Sometimes organs are removed or tissue samples are taken and checked under a microscope for signs of disease.     -  Abdominal and pelvic washings: A procedure in which a saline solution is placed into the abdominal and pelvic body cavities. After a short time, the fluid is removed and viewed under a microscope to check for cancer cells.    -  Total abdominal hysterectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the uterus and cervix through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen.     -  Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: Surgery to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.    -  Lymphadenectomy: A surgical procedure in which lymph nodes are removed and checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. For a regional lymphadenectomy, some of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. For a radical lymphadenectomy, most or all of the lymph nodes in the tumor area are removed. This procedure is also called lymph node dissection.         Treatment in addition to surgery may be given, as described in the Treatment Option Overview section of this summary.

                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if uterine sarcoma spreads to the lung, the cancer cells in the lung are actually uterine sarcoma cells. The disease is metastatic uterine sarcoma, not lung cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for uterine sarcoma:
                    Stage I    In stage I, cancer is found in the uterus only. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IA: Cancer is in the endometrium only or less than halfway through the myometrium (muscle layer of the uterus).     -  Stage IB: Cancer has spread halfway or more into the myometrium.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer has spread into connective tissue of the cervix, but has not spread outside the uterus.       Stage III    In stage III, cancer has spread beyond the uterus and cervix, but has not spread beyond the pelvis. Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC, based on how far the cancer has spread within the pelvis.            -  Stage IIIA: Cancer has spread to the outer layer of the uterus and/or to the fallopian tubes, ovaries, and ligaments of the uterus.     -  Stage IIIB: Cancer has spread to the vagina or to the parametrium (connective tissue and fat around the uterus).     -  Stage IIIC: Cancer has spread to lymph nodes in the pelvis and/or around the aorta (largest artery in the body, which carries blood away from the heart).              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the pelvis. Stage IV is divided into stages IVA and IVB, based on how far the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IVA: Cancer has spread to the bladder and/or bowel wall.     -  Stage IVB: Cancer has spread to other parts of the body beyond the pelvis, including the abdomen and/or lymph nodes in the groin.","To determine if uterine sarcoma has metastasized, several diagnostic tests are commonly employed. These tests are integral to the staging process, which helps to assess the extent of cancer spread and inform treatment options. The following tests are utilized:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: This initial exam checks for general health signs and any unusual findings such as lumps.
   
2. **Pelvic Exam**: A detailed examination of the reproductive organs to look for signs of disease.

3. **Pap Test**: Although this test may not detect uterine sarcoma directly (since it originates within the uterus), it can provide useful information about the health of the surrounding tissues.

4. **Transvaginal Ultrasound Exam**: This test uses sound waves to create images of the reproductive organs, helping to identify tumors.

5. **Dilatation and Curettage (D&C)**: This procedure involves removing tissue samples from the uterus to check for cancer under a microscope.

6. **Endometrial Biopsy**: Tissue from the inner lining of the uterus is removed and examined for cancer cells.

In addition to the above, staging tests may include:

- **Blood Chemistry Studies**: Tests that measure specific substances in the blood that may indicate disease.
  
- **CA 125 Assay**: A blood test that measures the level of the CA-125 protein, which can be elevated in certain cancers.

- **Chest X-ray**: To check for metastasis in the lungs.

- **CT Scan**: Provides detailed images of the abdomen and pelvis to identify any spread of cancer to nearby organs.

- **Cystoscopy**: Checks for abnormalities in the bladder.

Through these diagnostic and imaging tests, healthcare providers can ascertain whether the cancer has spread beyond the uterus, and if so, how far. This information is crucial for staging the disease appropriately, which directly impacts treatment decisions and prognosis.",13,"What diagnostic tests are commonly used to determine if uterine sarcoma has metastasized, and how do they contribute to the overall staging process?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely corresponds to the original answer by detailing the diagnostic tests used to determine if uterine sarcoma has metastasized and explaining their role in the staging process.

The prognosis for atypical CML, which affects the number of red blood cells and platelets in the blood, determines the treatment options available and the likely outcome for the patient. Low counts of red blood cells can indicate anemia, while low platelet counts can lead to increased risk of bleeding, both of which may necessitate specific interventions to manage symptoms and improve quality of life during treatment.",441,What role do red blood cell and platelet measurements play in the overall treatment strategy for atypical chronic myelogenous leukemia?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the role of red blood cell and platelet measurements in the treatment strategy for atypical CML, linking it to prognosis as mentioned in the original answer.

"A family history of breast cancer and other factors increase the risk of breast cancer.
                    Anything that increases your chance of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesn't mean that you will not get cancer. Talk to your doctor if you think you may be at risk for breast cancer.    Risk factors for breast cancer include the following:            - A personal history of invasive breast cancer, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), or lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS).     - A personal history of benign (noncancer) breast disease.     - A family history of breast cancer in a first-degree relative (mother, daughter, or sister).     - Inherited changes in the  BRCA1  or  BRCA2  genes or in other genes that increase the risk of breast cancer.     - Breast tissue that is dense on a mammogram.     -  Exposure of breast tissue to estrogen made by the body. This may be caused by:                  -  Menstruating at an early age.       -  Older age at first birth or never having given birth.       - Starting menopause at a later age.                - Taking hormones such as estrogen combined with progestin for symptoms of menopause.     - Treatment with radiation therapy to the breast/chest.     - Drinking alcohol.     -  Obesity.           Older age is the main risk factor for most cancers. The chance of getting cancer increases as you get older.      NCI's Breast Cancer Risk Assessment Tool uses a woman's risk factors to estimate her risk for breast cancer during the next five years and up to age 90. This online tool is meant to be used by a health care provider. For more information on breast cancer risk, call 1-800-4-CANCER.","Yes, there are lifestyle choices that may heighten the risk of breast cancer. Hormone therapy and alcohol consumption are two notable factors:

1. **Hormone Therapy**: Taking hormones, particularly estrogen combined with progestin for menopause symptoms, has been linked to an increased risk of breast cancer. This type of hormone replacement therapy (HRT) can expose breast tissue to estrogen, which may lead to cancer cell growth, especially in those with hormone receptor positive breast cancer.

2. **Alcohol Consumption**: Drinking alcohol is also associated with an increased risk of breast cancer. Research indicates that the level of risk rises with the amount of alcohol consumed.

These lifestyle choices can affect the hormonal and biological environment of the body, potentially creating conditions that favor the development of breast cancer.",688,"Are there lifestyle choices, such as hormone therapy or alcohol consumption, that may heighten the risk of breast cancer, and if so, how?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the original question about lifestyle choices that may increase the risk of breast cancer, specifically hormone therapy and alcohol consumption.

A history of the patients health habits, including smoking, and past jobs, illnesses, and treatments will also be taken.    -   Laboratory tests : Medical procedures that test samples of tissue, blood, urine, or other substances in the body. These tests help to diagnose disease, plan and check treatment, or monitor the disease over time.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan) of the brain, chest, and abdomen : A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Sputum cytology : A microscope is used to check for cancer cells in the sputum (mucus coughed up from the lungs).     -   Biopsy : The removal of cells or tissues so they can be viewed under a microscope by a pathologist to check for signs of cancer. The different ways a biopsy can be done include the following:                -  Fine-needle aspiration (FNA) biopsy of the lung: The removal of tissue or fluid from the lung, using a thin needle. A CT scan, ultrasound, or other imaging procedure is used to find the abnormal tissue or fluid in the lung. A small incision may be made in the skin where the biopsy needle is inserted into the abnormal tissue or fluid. A sample is removed with the needle and sent to the laboratory. A pathologist then views the sample under a microscope to look for cancer cells. A chest x-ray is done after the procedure to make sure no air is leaking from the lung into the chest.      -  Bronchoscopy : A procedure to look inside the trachea and large airways in the lung for abnormal areas. A bronchoscope is inserted through the nose or mouth into the trachea and lungs. A bronchoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.       -  Thoracoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs inside the chest to check for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made between two ribs, and a thoracoscope is inserted into the chest. A thoracoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer. In some cases, this procedure is used to remove part of the esophagus or lung. If certain tissues, organs, or lymph nodes cant be reached, a thoracotomy may be done. In this procedure, a larger incision is made between the ribs and the chest is opened.      -  Thoracentesis : The removal of fluid from the space between the lining of the chest and the lung, using a needle. A pathologist views the fluid under a microscope to look for cancer cells.      -  Mediastinoscopy : A surgical procedure to look at the organs, tissues, and lymph nodes between the lungs for abnormal areas. An incision (cut) is made at the top of the breastbone and a mediastinoscope is inserted into the chest. A mediastinoscope is a thin, tube-like instrument with a light and a lens for viewing. It may also have a tool to remove tissue or lymph node samples, which are checked under a microscope for signs of cancer.             -   Light and electron microscopy : A laboratory test in which cells in a sample of tissue are viewed under regular and high-powered microscopes to look for certain changes in the cells.    -   Immunohistochemistry : A test that uses antibodies to check for certain antigens in a sample of tissue. The antibody is usually linked to a radioactive substance or a dye that causes the tissue to light up under a microscope. This type of test may be used to tell the difference between different types of cancer.","The physical exam and patient history play a crucial role in the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer. During a physical exam, the doctor checks for general signs of health, including any lumps or unusual signs that may indicate disease. The patient history includes a detailed account of the patient's health habits, particularly smoking status, as well as past illnesses, jobs, and treatments, all of which may inform the risk factors and likelihood of cancer. This comprehensive background helps guide further testing and diagnostics for confirming the presence of cancer.",39,What role does a physical exam and patient history play in the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the role of the physical exam and patient history in the diagnosis of small cell lung cancer, closely mirroring the details provided in the original answer.

"Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:          - The type of soft tissue sarcoma.    - The size, grade, and stage of the tumor.    - How fast the cancer cells are growing and dividing.    - Where the tumor is in the body.     - Whether all of the tumor is removed by surgery.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has recurred (come back).","The location of the tumor is important in determining the likelihood of complete surgical removal and subsequent recovery for those with soft tissue sarcoma. According to the context, the prognosis and treatment options depend on several factors, including where the tumor is located in the body. Tumors that are located in more accessible or less vital areas may be easier to remove completely through surgery, which is crucial for improving the chance of recovery. In contrast, tumors located deeper in the body, such as those in the abdomen, may be more difficult to remove entirely and can cause complications as they press on nearby organs, nerves, or blood vessels. Therefore, the tumor's location influences both the feasibility of surgical intervention and the overall treatment strategy.",725,How important is the location of the tumor in determining the likelihood of complete surgical removal and subsequent recovery for those with soft tissue sarcoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the importance of the tumor's location, which is specifically mentioned in the original answer as a factor influencing treatment options and prognosis.

                    There are different types of treatments for patients with intraocular melanoma.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with intraocular melanoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Five types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery is the most common treatment for intraocular melanoma. The following types of surgery may be used:            -  Resection: Surgery to remove the tumor and a small amount of healthy tissue around it.     -  Enucleation: Surgery to remove the eye and part of the optic nerve. This is done if vision cannot be saved and the tumor is large, has spread to the optic nerve, or causes high pressure inside the eye. After surgery, the patient is usually fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye.      -  Exenteration: Surgery to remove the eye and eyelid, and muscles, nerves, and fat in the eye socket. After surgery, the patient may be fitted for an artificial eye to match the size and color of the other eye or a facial prosthesis.              Watchful Waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change. Pictures are taken over time to keep track of changes in the size of the tumor and how fast it is growing.    Watchful waiting is used for patients who do not have signs or symptoms and the tumor is not growing. It is also used when the tumor is in the only eye with useful vision.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging nearby healthy tissue. These types of external radiation therapy include the following:                  -  Charged-particle external beam radiation therapy is a type of external-beam radiation therapy. A special radiation therapy machine aims tiny, invisible particles, called protons or helium ions, at the cancer cells to kill them with little damage to nearby normal tissues. Charged-particle radiation therapy uses a different type of radiation than the x-ray type of radiation therapy.       -  Gamma Knife therapy is a type of stereotactic radiosurgery used for some melanomas. This treatment can be given in one treatment. It aims tightly focused gamma rays directly at the tumor so there is little damage to healthy tissue. Gamma Knife therapy does not use a knife to remove the tumor and is not an operation.                -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer. Certain ways of giving radiation therapy can help keep radiation from damaging healthy tissue. This type of internal radiation therapy may include the following:                  -  Localized plaque radiation therapy is a type of internal radiation therapy that may be used for tumors of the eye. Radioactive seeds are attached to one side of a disk, called a plaque, and placed directly on the outside wall of the eye near the tumor. The side of the plaque with the seeds on it faces the eyeball, aiming radiation at the tumor. The plaque helps protect other nearby tissue from the radiation.                       The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated. External and internal radiation therapy are used to treat intraocular melanoma.        Photocoagulation     Photocoagulation is a procedure that uses laser light to destroy blood vessels that bring nutrients to the tumor, causing the tumor cells to die. Photocoagulation may be used to treat small tumors. This is also called light coagulation.        Thermotherapy     Thermotherapy is the use of heat from a laser to destroy cancer cells and shrink the tumor.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Treatment for intraocular (uveal) melanoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects caused by treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood stem cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A myeloid stem cell becomes a red blood cell, white blood cell, or platelet. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a lymphoblast and then one of three types of lymphocytes (white blood cells):         -  B-cell lymphocytes that make antibodies to help fight infection.    -  T-cell lymphocytes that help B-lymphocytes make the antibodies that help fight infection.    -  Natural killer cells that attack cancer cells and viruses.         In mycosis fungoides, T-cell lymphocytes become cancerous and affect the skin. In the Szary syndrome, cancerous T-cell lymphocytes affect the skin and are in the blood.

It is not known if the Szary syndrome is an advanced form of mycosis fungoides or a separate disease.","The diagnostic methods for Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome differ primarily in the findings from skin and blood examinations. 

In Mycosis fungoides, the diagnosis involves examining the skin for signs such as a red rash and conducting skin biopsies to confirm the presence of cancerous T-cell lymphocytes. The entire process may require multiple skin biopsies to reach a definitive diagnosis.

In contrast, for the Szary syndrome, the diagnosis is characterized by the detection of cancerous T-cells in the blood, as well as skin examination. A complete blood count and peripheral blood smear can be conducted to identify the presence of these malignant cells.

Overall, while both conditions utilize skin examinations, the Szary syndrome explicitly includes blood tests to detect cancerous cells, whereas Mycosis fungoides relies more heavily on skin biopsies.",495,How do the diagnostic methods for Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome differ in terms of examining the skin and blood?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the diagnostic methods for Mycosis fungoides and the Szary syndrome, highlighting the differences in skin and blood examinations as specified in the original answer.

                    After adult Hodgkin lymphoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the lymph system or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography. For adult Hodgkin lymphoma, CT scans of the neck, chest, abdomen, and pelvis are taken.    -   PET-CT scan : A procedure that combines the pictures from a positron emission tomography (PET) scan and a computed tomography (CT) scan. The PET and CT scans are done at the same time on the same machine. The pictures from both scans are combined to make a more detailed picture than either test would make by itself. A PET scan is a procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.    -   Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy : The removal of bone marrow, blood, and a small piece of bone by inserting a hollow needle into the hipbone or breastbone. A pathologist views the bone marrow, blood, and bone under a microscope to look for signs of cancer.         For pregnant women with Hodgkin lymphoma, staging tests that protect the fetus from the harms of radiation are used. These include:         -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Stages of adult Hodgkin lymphoma may include A, B, E, and S.
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be described as follows:         - A: The patient does not have B symptoms (fever, weight loss, or night sweats).    - B: The patient has B symptoms.    - E: Cancer is found in an organ or tissue that is not part of the lymph system but which may be next to an involved area of the lymph system.    - S: Cancer is found in the spleen.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for adult Hodgkin lymphoma:
                    Stage I      Stage I is divided into stage I and stage IE.            - Stage I: Cancer is found in one of the following places in the lymph system:                  - One or more lymph nodes in one lymph node group.       - Waldeyer's ring.       -  Thymus.       -  Spleen.                - Stage IE: Cancer is found outside the lymph system in one organ or area.              Stage II      Stage II is divided into stage II and stage IIE.            - Stage II: Cancer is found in two or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     - Stage IIE: Cancer is found in one or more lymph node groups either above or below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.              Stage III      Stage III is divided into stage III, stage IIIE, stage IIIS, and stage IIIE,S.            - Stage III: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm (the thin muscle below the lungs that helps breathing and separates the chest from the abdomen).     - Stage IIIE: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm and outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area.      - Stage IIIS: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, and in the spleen.     - Stage IIIE,S: Cancer is found in lymph node groups above and below the diaphragm, outside the lymph nodes in a nearby organ or area, and in the spleen.               Stage IV     In stage IV, the cancer:            - is found outside the lymph nodes throughout one or more organs, and may be in lymph nodes near those organs; or     - is found outside the lymph nodes in one organ and has spread to areas far away from that organ; or     - is found in the lung, liver, bone marrow, or cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). The cancer has not spread to the lung, liver, bone marrow, or CSF from nearby areas.
                
                
                    Adult Hodgkin lymphoma may be grouped for treatment as follows:
                    Early Favorable    Early favorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II, without risk factors.        Early Unfavorable    Early unfavorable adult Hodgkin lymphoma is stage I or stage II with one or more of the following risk factors:            - A tumor in the chest that is larger than 1/3 of the width of the chest or at least 10 centimeters.     -  Cancer in an organ other than the lymph nodes.     - A high sedimentation rate (in a sample of blood, the red blood cells settle to the bottom of the test tube more quickly than normal).     - Three or more lymph nodes with cancer.     - Symptoms such as fever, weight loss, or night sweats.              Advanced    Advanced Hodgkin lymphoma includes some or all of the following risk factors:            - Being male.      - Being aged 45 years or older.      - Having stage IV disease.      - Having a low blood albumin (protein) level (below 4).      - Having a low hemoglobin level (below 10.5).      - Having a high white blood cell count (15,000 or higher).      - Having a low lymphocyte count (below 600 or less than 8% of the white blood cell count).","The distinction between the A and B classifications in the staging of adult Hodgkin lymphoma is significant because it informs the presence or absence of ""B symptoms."" 

- **A** classification indicates that the patient does not have B symptoms, which include fever, unexplained weight loss, and night sweats.
- **B** classification implies that the patient has one or more of these B symptoms.

These classifications help healthcare providers assess the severity and prognosis of the disease, and they are critical for determining the appropriate treatment approach. The presence of B symptoms often indicates a more aggressive disease and can influence treatment decisions and the overall management plan for the patient.",296,Can you explain the significance of distinguishing between the A and B classifications in the staging of adult Hodgkin lymphoma?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the significance of distinguishing between the A and B classifications in adult Hodgkin lymphoma, aligning well with the relevant details provided in the original answer. It addresses the importance of B symptoms, their implications for the patient's condition, and how this distinction impacts treatment decisions, matching the key points outlined in the original content."
Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery) depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (especially the size of the tumor).    - The type of salivary gland the cancer is in.    - The type of cancer cells (how they look under a microscope).    - The patient's age and general health.,"A patient's age can significantly affect both their prognosis and the treatment options chosen for salivary gland cancer. Specifically, older age is identified as a risk factor for salivary gland cancer, and it may influence the overall health and resilience of the patient, potentially affecting their ability to tolerate certain treatments.

In terms of prognosis, older patients may face a different outlook compared to younger individuals, as age can impact the cancer's aggressiveness and the body’s capability to recover. Additionally, treatment options vary based on the patient's age and general health, which implies that older patients might have different considerations when planning treatment—such as the choice between aggressive therapies or more conservative approaches.

As noted in the context, the prognosis also depends on various factors, including the cancer stage, the type of salivary gland involved, and the type of cancer cells present. Therefore, age plays a crucial role alongside these factors in dictating both the expected outcomes and the treatment strategy for salivary gland cancer.",220,How might a patient's age affect their prognosis and the treatment options chosen for salivary gland cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses how a patient's age affects both their prognosis and treatment options for salivary gland cancer, which is a key aspect mentioned in the original answer.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with ovarian epithelial cancer.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with ovarian epithelial cancer. Some treatments are standard, and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the treatment currently used as standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients with any stage of ovarian cancer may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Three kinds of standard treatment are used.
                    Surgery     Most patients have surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Different types of surgery may include:            -  Hysterectomy: Surgery to remove the uterus and, sometimes, the cervix. When only the uterus is removed, it is called a partial hysterectomy. When both the uterus and the cervix are removed, it is called a total hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through the vagina, the operation is called a vaginal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a large incision (cut) in the abdomen, the operation is called a total abdominal hysterectomy. If the uterus and cervix are taken out through a small incision (cut) in the abdomen using a laparoscope, the operation is called a total laparoscopic hysterectomy.     -  Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove one ovary and one fallopian tube.     -  Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy: A surgical procedure to remove both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.     -  Omentectomy: A surgical procedure to remove the omentum (tissue in the peritoneum that contains blood vessels, nerves, lymph vessels, and lymph nodes).      - Lymph node biopsy: The removal of all or part of a lymph node. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells.              Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     A type of regional chemotherapy used to treat ovarian cancer is intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. In IP chemotherapy, the anticancer drugs are carried directly into the peritoneal cavity (the space that contains the abdominal organs) through a thin tube.     Treatment with more than one anticancer drug is called combination chemotherapy.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells.     Bevacizumab is a monoclonal antibody that may be used with chemotherapy to treat ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, or primary peritoneal cancer that has recurred (come back).     Poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase inhibitors (PARP inhibitors) are targeted therapy drugs that block DNA repair and may cause cancer cells to die. Olaparib and niraparib are PARP inhibitors that may be used to treat advanced ovarian cancer.     See Drugs Approved for Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, or Primary Peritoneal Cancer for more information.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. Some women receive a treatment called intraperitoneal radiation therapy, in which radioactive liquid is put directly in the abdomen through a catheter. Intraperitoneal radiation therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.       Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy.     Vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat advanced ovarian cancer.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

1. **Systemic Chemotherapy**: This involves the use of drugs that are taken orally or injected into a vein or muscle, allowing the chemotherapy drugs to enter the bloodstream and reach cancer cells throughout the body. This method is designed to stop the growth of cancer cells or kill them by affecting cells all over the body.

2. **Regional Chemotherapy**: This approach delivers chemotherapy drugs directly into a specific area of the body where the cancer is located, primarily affecting the cancer cells in that area. A common type of regional chemotherapy used for ovarian cancer is intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy. In IP chemotherapy, anticancer drugs are introduced directly into the peritoneal cavity (the space within the abdomen that contains the abdominal organs) through a thin tube, targeting the cancer cells mainly in that localized area.

                    Tests and procedures to stage pancreatic cancer are usually done at the same time as diagnosis.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the pancreas or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage of the disease in order to plan treatment. The results of some of the tests used to diagnose pancreatic cancer are often also used to stage the disease. See the General Information section for more information.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if pancreatic cancer spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually pancreatic cancer cells. The disease is metastatic pancreatic cancer, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for pancreatic cancer:
                    Stage 0 (Carcinoma in Situ)    In stage 0, abnormal cells are found in the lining of the pancreas. These abnormal cells may become cancer and spread into nearby normal tissue. Stage 0 is also called carcinoma in situ.        Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed and is found in the pancreas only. Stage I is divided into stage IA and stage IB, based on the size of the tumor.            -  Stage IA: The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.     -  Stage IB: The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters.              Stage II    In stage II, cancer may have spread to nearby tissue and organs, and may have spread to lymph nodes near the pancreas. Stage II is divided into stage IIA and stage IIB, based on where the cancer has spread.            -  Stage IIA: Cancer has spread to nearby tissue and organs but has not spread to nearby lymph nodes.     -  Stage IIB: Cancer has spread to nearby lymph nodes and may have spread to nearby tissue and organs.              Stage III     In stage III, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may have spread to nearby lymph nodes.        Stage IV     In stage IV, cancer may be of any size and has spread to distant organs, such as the liver, lung, and peritoneal cavity. It may have also spread to organs and tissues near the pancreas or to lymph nodes.","The implications of pancreatic cancer spreading to major blood vessels, as outlined in Stage III, include significant challenges for treatment and a generally poorer prognosis. At this stage, cancer has spread to the major blood vessels near the pancreas and may involve nearby lymph nodes. This means that:

1. **Surgery Limitations**: Surgical options may be limited or not feasible since the cancer's involvement with major blood vessels complicates complete surgical removal of the tumor.

2. **Increased Treatment Complexity**: Treatment typically shifts towards palliative measures, chemotherapy, and chemoradiation, as the ability to completely eliminate the cancer through surgery is diminished.

3. **Prognosis**: The prognosis for patients in Stage III is generally worse compared to earlier stages due to the extent of cancer spread, which is harder to control and treat effectively.

Overall, Stage III pancreatic cancer signifies a more advanced disease state that requires careful consideration of treatment options, focusing on managing symptoms and improving quality of life.",676,What are the implications of pancreatic cancer spreading to major blood vessels as outlined in Stage III?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the implications of pancreatic cancer spreading to major blood vessels as described in Stage III, discussing treatment challenges, surgery limitations, treatment complexity, and prognosis. It aligns closely with the original answer by focusing on the advanced state of the disease and necessary considerations for patient care, thus providing a detailed and relevant response."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the type of tumor and whether the tumor has spread into other areas of the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) or outside of the central nervous system to other parts of the body.   Treatment options depend on the following:         - The type and size of the tumor.    - Whether the tumor is making hormones.    - Whether the tumor is causing problems with vision or other signs or symptoms.    - Whether the tumor has spread into the brain around the pituitary gland or to other parts of the body.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).,"Symptoms indicating that a pituitary tumor may be impacting vision include:

- Some loss of vision, which can occur due to the tumor pressing on the optic nerves.
  
These vision-related symptoms are critical in treatment decisions because they can signify the need for more immediate or aggressive interventions. For example, if a pituitary tumor is causing vision impairment, surgical options may be prioritized to relieve pressure on the optic nerves, followed by possible adjunct therapies like radiation or drug therapy, depending on the tumor's type, size, and hormonal activity. Additionally, ongoing monitoring of vision is important in determining the effectiveness of treatment and the necessity for any further interventions.",197,"What symptoms indicate that a pituitary tumor may be impacting vision, and how does this relate to treatment decisions?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses symptoms related to vision impairment caused by a pituitary tumor, which ties into the original content.

                    Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a type of cancer in which the bone marrow makes abnormal myeloblasts (a type of white blood cell), red blood cells, or platelets.
                    Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) is a cancer of the blood and bone marrow. This type of cancer usually gets worse quickly if it is not treated. It is the most common type of acute leukemia in adults. AML is also called acute myelogenous leukemia, acute myeloblastic leukemia, acute granulocytic leukemia, and acute nonlymphocytic leukemia.
                
                
                    Leukemia may affect red blood cells, white blood cells, and platelets.
                    Normally, the bone marrow makes blood stem cells (immature cells) that become mature blood cells over time. A blood stem cell may become a myeloid stem cell or a lymphoid stem cell. A lymphoid stem cell becomes a white blood cell.    A myeloid stem cell becomes one of three types of mature blood cells:         -  Red blood cells that carry oxygen and other substances to all tissues of the body.    - White blood cells that fight infection and disease.    -  Platelets that form blood clots to stop bleeding.         In AML, the myeloid stem cells usually become a type of immature white blood cell called myeloblasts (or myeloid blasts). The myeloblasts in AML are abnormal and do not become healthy white blood cells. Sometimes in AML, too many stem cells become abnormal red blood cells or platelets. These abnormal white blood cells, red blood cells, or platelets are also called leukemia cells or blasts. Leukemia cells can build up in the bone marrow and blood so there is less room for healthy white blood cells, red blood cells, and platelets. When this happens, infection, anemia, or easy bleeding may occur. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood to other parts of the body, including the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums.   This summary is about adult AML. See the following PDQ summaries for information about other types of leukemia:         -  Childhood Acute Myeloid Leukemia/Other Myeloid Malignancies Treatment     -  Chronic Myelogenous Leukemia Treatment     -  Adult Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment     -  Childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia Treatment     -  Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia Treatment     -  Hairy Cell Leukemia Treatment
                
                
                    There are different subtypes of AML.
                    Most AML subtypes are based on how mature (developed) the cancer cells are at the time of diagnosis and how different they are from normal cells.     Acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) is a subtype of AML that occurs when parts of two genes stick together. APL usually occurs in middle-aged adults. Signs of APL may include both bleeding and forming blood clots.","Adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can affect other parts of the body beyond the blood and bone marrow in several ways. The leukemia cells can spread outside the blood, infiltrating areas such as the central nervous system (brain and spinal cord), skin, and gums. In some cases, they may form solid tumors called granulocytic sarcomas or chloromas. These manifestations can lead to various complications, including infections, anemia, and prolonged bleeding, as the abnormal cells crowd out healthy blood cells.

The implications of these effects on prognosis are significant. The prognosis for adults with AML depends on various factors, including the age of the patient, the subtype of AML, and any prior chemotherapy treatments. Moreover, the presence of leukemia outside of the blood and bone marrow, particularly if it has spread to the central nervous system, can negatively impact the prognosis and treatment options. Overall, the ability of the leukemia cells to metastasize indicates a more aggressive disease, often linked to poorer outcomes if not treated promptly. Additionally, the response to treatment plays a critical role in determining recovery chances.",679,"In what ways can adult acute myeloid leukemia cells affect other parts of the body beyond the blood and bone marrow, and what implications does this have for prognosis?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question about how adult acute myeloid leukemia (AML) cells can affect other parts of the body, consistent with the information provided in the original answer.

Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery). The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:          - The type of germ cell tumor.    - The type and level of any tumor markers.    - Where the tumor is in the brain or in the spinal cord.    -  Whether the cancer has spread within the brain and spinal cord or to other parts of the body.     - Whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred (come back) after treatment.,"The spread of cancer within the central nervous system (CNS) or to other parts of the body significantly impacts the prognosis for childhood germ cell tumors. Specifically, the prognosis depends on whether the tumor has spread within the CNS or to other parts of the body. Generally, childhood CNS germ cell tumors rarely spread outside the brain and spinal cord, which can lead to better outcomes. However, when these tumors do spread, it may complicate treatment and negatively affect recovery chances. Therefore, the location of the tumor, its type, and the extent of its spread are critical factors in determining the prognosis for children with germ cell tumors.",448,How does the spread of cancer within the central nervous system or to other parts of the body affect the prognosis for childhood germ cell tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the impact of the spread of cancer on the prognosis for childhood germ cell tumors, which is a key factor mentioned in the original answer.

                    - Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.    - In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.    -  Different factors increase or decrease the risk of getting ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancer.
                
                
                    Ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers are diseases in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the ovaries, fallopian tubes, or peritoneum.
                    The ovaries are a pair of organs in the female reproductive system. They are located in the pelvis, one on each side of the uterus (the hollow, pear-shaped organ where a fetus grows). Each ovary is about the size and shape of an almond. The ovaries produce eggs and female hormones (chemicals that control the way certain cells or organs function).   The fallopian tubes are a pair of long, slender tubes, one on each side of the uterus. Eggs pass from the ovaries, through the fallopian tubes, to the uterus. Cancer sometimes begins at the end of the fallopian tube near the ovary and spreads to the ovary.   The peritoneum is the tissue that lines the abdominal wall and covers organs in the abdomen. Primary peritoneal cancer is cancer that forms in the peritoneum and has not spread there from another part of the body. Cancer sometimes begins in the peritoneum and spreads to the ovary.     Ovarian epithelial cancer, fallopian tube cancer, and primary peritoneal cancer form in the same type of tissue. Studies of screening tests look at these cancers together.    See the following PDQ summaries for more information about ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers:         -   Ovarian, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Prevention     -  Genetics of Breast and Gynecologic Cancers     -  Ovarian Epithelial, Fallopian Tube, and Primary Peritoneal Cancer Treatment     -  Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment     -  Ovarian Low Malignant Potential Tumors Treatment
                
                
                    In the United States, ovarian cancer is the fifth leading cause of cancer death in women.
                    Ovarian cancer is also the leading cause of death from cancer of the female reproductive system. Over the last 20 years, the number of new cases of ovarian cancer has gone down slightly in white women and in black women. Since 2005, the number of deaths from ovarian cancer also decreased slightly in white and black women.","For the treatment options available for ovarian, fallopian tube, and primary peritoneal cancers, here are the key details:

1. **Surgery**: The majority of patients will undergo surgery to remove as much of the tumor as possible. Types of surgery may include:
   - **Hysterectomy**: Removing the uterus (partial or total).
   - **Unilateral salpingo-oophorectomy**: Removing one ovary and one fallopian tube.
   - **Bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy**: Removing both ovaries and both fallopian tubes.
   - **Omentectomy**: Removing the omentum (tissue in the peritoneum).
   - **Lymph node biopsy**: Removing part or all of a lymph node to check for cancer cells.

2. **Chemotherapy**: This treatment uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing them or stopping their division. There are two approaches to administering chemotherapy:
   - **Systemic chemotherapy**: Drugs enter the bloodstream and affect cancer cells throughout the body.
   - **Regional chemotherapy**: Drugs are placed directly into the abdomen or another specific area where the cancer is located. Notably, **intraperitoneal (IP) chemotherapy** involves administering drugs directly into the peritoneal cavity.

3. **Targeted Therapy**: This type of treatment uses drugs that target specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Some examples include:
   - **Monoclonal antibody therapy**: Such as Bevacizumab, which may be used with chemotherapy for recurrent cases.
   - **PARP inhibitors**: Such as Olaparib and Niraparib, which are utilized in advanced ovarian cancer.

4. **New Treatments**: Research is ongoing, and new types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials, which may include:
   - **Radiation Therapy**: Using high-energy x-rays or other radiation to kill cancer cells, with techniques such as intraperitoneal radiation therapy being studied.
   - **Immunotherapy**: This treatment aims to enhance the immune system's ability to fight cancer, which may include vaccine therapy.

5. **Clinical Trials**: Patients are encouraged to consider participation in clinical trials, which may offer access to new therapies or approaches not yet widely available.

Treatment plans may vary based on the disease stage, and ongoing assessments will be conducted to determine treatment efficacy and adjust as needed.

3. **Carcinoid tumors**: These tumors arise from neuroendocrine cells and can produce hormones, affecting treatment decisions and patient management.

4. **Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs)**: These tumors arise from the interstitial cells of Cajal in the gastrointestinal tract and can behave aggressively or be more indolent, influencing treatments.

5. **Lymphoma**: This cancer type arises from lymphatic tissue and affects treatment options considerably due to its systemic nature.

                    Breast cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the breast.
                    The breast is made up of lobes and ducts. Each breast has 15 to 20 sections called lobes, which have many smaller sections called lobules. Lobules end in dozens of tiny bulbs that can make milk. The lobes, lobules, and bulbs are linked by thin tubes called ducts.     Each breast also has blood vessels and lymph vessels. The lymph vessels carry an almost colorless fluid called lymph. Lymph vessels lead to organs called lymph nodes. Lymph nodes are small bean-shaped structures that are found throughout the body. They filter lymph and store white blood cells that help fight infection and disease. Clusters of lymph nodes are found near the breast in the axilla (under the arm), above the collarbone, and in the chest.

1. **Management**: Treatment options for CLL depend on blood counts. For instance, abnormal levels of white blood cells can significantly influence the stage and aggressiveness of the disease, guiding treatment decisions. Low red blood cell counts (anemia) or low platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) can also affect treatment plans, as these conditions may necessitate more careful management and adjustment of treatment to avoid further complications.

2. **Outlook**: Prognosis is influenced by these blood counts. Specifically, the number of white blood cells and the presence of anemia can indicate how advanced the disease is, which can impact the overall chance of recovery. Furthermore, the overall health of the patient, including these blood parameters, is considered when evaluating the likelihood of treatment success or disease progression.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with osteosarcoma or MFH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating osteosarcoma and MFH and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    - Orthopedic surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Treatment for osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to remove the entire tumor will be done when possible. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to make the tumor smaller. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is given so less bone tissue needs to be removed and there are fewer problems after surgery.     The following types of surgery may be done:            -  Wide local excision: Surgery to remove the cancer and some healthy tissue around it.     -  Limb-sparing surgery: Removal of the tumor in a limb (arm or leg) without amputation, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved. Most patients with osteosarcoma in a limb can be treated with limb-sparing surgery. The tumor is removed by wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an implant such as artificial bone. If a fracture is found at diagnosis or during chemotherapy before surgery, limb-sparing surgery may still be possible in some cases. If the surgeon is not able to remove all of the tumor and enough healthy tissue around it, an amputation may be done.     -  Amputation: Surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg. This may be done when it is not possible to remove all of the tumor in limb-sparing surgery. The patient may be fitted with a prosthesis (artificial limb) after amputation.     -  Rotationplasty: Surgery to remove the tumor and the knee joint. The part of the leg that remains below the knee is then attached to the part of the leg that remains above the knee, with the foot facing backward and the ankle acting as a knee. A prosthesis may then be attached to the foot.           Studies have shown that survival is the same whether the first surgery done is a limb-sparing surgery or an amputation.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients are also given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left in the area where the tumor was removed or that have spread to other parts of the body. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    In the treatment of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytosis of bone, chemotherapy is usually given before and after surgery to remove the primary tumor.    See Drugs Approved for Bone Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Osteosarcoma and MFH cells are not killed easily by external radiation therapy. It may be used when a small amount of cancer is left after surgery or used together with other treatments.       Samarium     Samarium is a radioactive drug that targets areas where bone cells are growing, such as tumor cells in bone. It helps relieve pain caused by cancer in the bone and it also kills blood cells in the bone marrow. It also is used to treat osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment in a different bone.    Treatment with samarium may be followed by stem cell transplant. Before treatment with samarium, stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After treatment with samarium is complete, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.

Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to find and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Kinase inhibitor therapy and monoclonal antibody therapy are types of targeted therapy being studied in clinical trials for osteosarcoma.     Kinase inhibitor therapy blocks a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. Sorafenib is a type of kinase inhibitor therapy being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Denosumab, dinutuximab, and glembatumumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

1. **Limb-Sparing Surgery**: This procedure involves removing the tumor from a limb without amputating it, allowing the patient to retain the use and appearance of the limb. It is often possible for many patients with osteosarcoma located in the limb, and usually includes a wide local excision where the tumor and some surrounding healthy tissue are removed. The removed tissue and bone may be replaced with a graft or an artificial implant. Limb-sparing surgery remains an option even if there is a fracture at diagnosis or during chemotherapy, but it is contingent upon the surgeon being able to remove all the tumor along with sufficient healthy tissue.

2. **Amputation**: This procedure involves the surgical removal of part or all of an arm or leg. It is performed when limb-sparing surgery is not viable, particularly if the surgeon cannot completely remove the tumor. Following amputation, patients may be fitted with a prosthesis.

3. **Rotationplasty**: Involves the removal of the tumor along with the knee joint, where the lower part of the leg is then rotated and attached to the upper part of the leg. This allows the ankle to function as a knee joint, and a prosthesis can be attached to the foot.

**Factors Influencing the Choice of Surgery**:
- The ability to completely remove the tumor and surrounding healthy tissue.
- The location and size of the tumor.
- Whether the tumor has caused a fracture.
- The overall health and age of the patient.
- The patient's preferences regarding limb preservation and post-surgical functionality.

Ultimately, the decision on which surgical approach to take is influenced by a combination of clinical factors regarding the tumor and personal considerations regarding quality of life post-treatment. Studies show that survival rates are similar whether patients undergo limb-sparing surgery or amputation when the first surgery is properly performed.",94,"What are the differences between the types of surgeries used for treating osteosarcoma, such as limb-sparing surgery and amputation, and what factors influence the choice of surgery?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer comprehensively discusses the types of surgeries (limb-sparing surgery, amputation, rotationplasty) for osteosarcoma, detailing the procedures and factors influencing the choice of surgery.

                    - Oropharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the oropharynx.    - Smoking or being infected with human papillomavirus can increase the risk of oropharyngeal cancer.     - Signs and symptoms of oropharyngeal cancer include a lump in the neck and a sore throat.     - Tests that examine the mouth and throat are used to help detect (find), diagnose, and stage oropharyngeal cancer.    - Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options.
                
                
                    Oropharyngeal cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the oropharynx.
                    The oropharynx is the middle part of the pharynx (throat), behind the mouth. The pharynx is a hollow tube about 5 inches long that starts behind the nose and ends where the trachea (windpipe) and esophagus (tube from the throat to the stomach) begin. Air and food pass through the pharynx on the way to the trachea or the esophagus.     The oropharynx includes the following:         -  Soft palate.    - Side and back walls of the throat.    -  Tonsils.    - Back one-third of the tongue.          Oropharyngeal cancer is a type of head and neck cancer. Sometimes more than one cancer can occur in the oropharynx and in other parts of the oral cavity, nose, pharynx, larynx (voice box), trachea, or esophagus at the same time.   Most oropharyngeal cancers are squamous cell carcinomas. Squamous cells are the thin, flat cells that line the inside of the oropharynx.   See the following PDQ summaries for more information about other types of head and neck cancers:         -  Hypopharyngeal Cancer Treatment     -  Lip and Oral Cavity Cancer Treatment     -  Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancer Prevention     -  Oral Cavity and Oropharyngeal Cancer Screening","Common diagnostic tests used to detect oropharyngeal cancer include:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: This involves a thorough examination of the mouth and throat to look for unusual signs, such as swollen lymph nodes.

2. **PET-CT Scan**: This combined imaging test offers detailed pictures of internal areas, helping in diagnosis and treatment planning.

3. **CT Scan**: Provides a series of detailed images of the head and neck, which aids in identifying the extent of the cancer.

4. **PET Scan**: Utilizes radioactive glucose to detect areas of increased metabolic activity, helping locate malignant tumor cells.

5. **MRI**: Employs magnetic fields and radio waves to produce detailed images of the oropharyngeal region.

6. **Biopsy**: Involves removing tissue samples to be examined microscopically for cancer signs. This is crucial for definitive diagnosis.

7. **Endoscopy and Laryngoscopy**: These procedures allow direct visualization of the throat and the removal of tissue samples, enhancing diagnosis.

8. **HPV Test**: Identifies specific types of human papillomavirus linked to oropharyngeal cancer.

These diagnostic tests not only help in detecting the presence of oropharyngeal cancer but also play a significant role in staging the disease. The information gathered helps determine the extent of cancer spread within the oropharynx and to other parts of the body, which is vital for devising an appropriate treatment plan.",327,"What types of diagnostic tests are commonly used to detect oropharyngeal cancer, and how do these tests contribute to staging the disease?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely addresses the original question regarding diagnostic tests for oropharyngeal cancer and elaborates on their role in staging the disease, which aligns with the original answer's discussion about detection and diagnostic processes.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with pancreatic NETs.
                    Different types of treatments are available for patients with pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Six types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     An operation may be done to remove the tumor. One of the following types of surgery may be used:            -  Enucleation: Surgery to remove the tumor only. This may be done when cancer occurs in one place in the pancreas.     -  Pancreatoduodenectomy: A surgical procedure in which the head of the pancreas, the gallbladder, nearby lymph nodes and part of the stomach, small intestine, and bile duct are removed. Enough of the pancreas is left to make digestive juices and insulin. The organs removed during this procedure depend on the patient's condition. This is also called the Whipple procedure.     -  Distal pancreatectomy: Surgery to remove the body and tail of the pancreas. The spleen may also be removed.     - Total gastrectomy: Surgery to remove the whole stomach.     -  Parietal cell vagotomy: Surgery to cut the nerve that causes stomach cells to make acid.     -  Liver resection: Surgery to remove part or all of the liver.     -  Radiofrequency ablation: The use of a special probe with tiny electrodes that kill cancer cells. Sometimes the probe is inserted directly through the skin and only local anesthesia is needed. In other cases, the probe is inserted through an incision in the abdomen. This is done in the hospital with general anesthesia.      -  Cryosurgical ablation: A procedure in which tissue is frozen to destroy abnormal cells. This is usually done with a special instrument that contains liquid nitrogen or liquid carbon dioxide. The instrument may be used during surgery or laparoscopy or inserted through the skin. This procedure is also called cryoablation.               Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the cancer being treated.       Hormone therapy     Hormone therapy is a cancer treatment that removes hormones or blocks their action and stops cancer cells from growing. Hormones are substances made by glands in the body and circulated in the bloodstream. Some hormones can cause certain cancers to grow. If tests show that the cancer cells have places where hormones can attach (receptors), drugs, surgery, or radiation therapy is used to reduce the production of hormones or block them from working.       Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization     Hepatic arterial occlusion uses drugs, small particles, or other agents to block or reduce the flow of blood to the liver through the hepatic artery (the major blood vessel that carries blood to the liver). This is done to kill cancer cells growing in the liver. The tumor is prevented from getting the oxygen and nutrients it needs to grow. The liver continues to receive blood from the hepatic portal vein, which carries blood from the stomach and intestine.    Chemotherapy delivered during hepatic arterial occlusion is called chemoembolization. The anticancer drug is injected into the hepatic artery through a catheter (thin tube). The drug is mixed with the substance that blocks the artery and cuts off blood flow to the tumor. Most of the anticancer drug is trapped near the tumor and only a small amount of the drug reaches other parts of the body.    The blockage may be temporary or permanent, depending on the substance used to block the artery.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Certain types of targeted therapies are being studied in the treatment of pancreatic NETs.       Supportive care     Supportive care is given to lessen the problems caused by the disease or its treatment. Supportive care for pancreatic NETs may include treatment for the following:            - Stomach ulcers may be treated with drug therapy such as:                  -  Proton pump inhibitor drugs such as omeprazole, lansoprazole, or pantoprazole.       - Histamine blocking drugs such as cimetidine, ranitidine, or famotidine.       - Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.                -  Diarrhea may be treated with:                   -  Intravenous (IV) fluids with electrolytes such as potassium or chloride.        - Somatostatin-type drugs such as octreotide.                - Low blood sugar may be treated by having small, frequent meals or with drug therapy to maintain a normal blood sugar level.     -  High blood sugar may be treated with drugs taken by mouth or insulin by injection.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

General information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.","Hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization, also known as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE), is a specialized treatment method used for managing liver metastases, including those from pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs). This procedure involves the targeted delivery of chemotherapy directly to the liver tumor through its blood supply, specifically the hepatic artery.

In TACE, a catheter is inserted into the hepatic artery, and a chemotherapeutic agent is injected. This is often combined with a substance that blocks the artery, effectively cutting off the blood flow to the tumor. As a result, the tumor is deprived of essential oxygen and nutrients, which are critical for its growth and survival. The localized high concentration of the drug trapped near the tumor aims to enhance the therapeutic effect while limiting systemic exposure, which may reduce side effects experienced by the patient.

This method is particularly useful for patients with liver metastases who may not be candidates for surgical resection. By targeting the liver directly, TACE can effectively shrink tumors or slow their progression, thus offering a palliative treatment option that may improve quality of life for patients suffering from metastatic diseases like pancreatic NETs.",719,Can you explain the concept of hepatic arterial occlusion or chemoembolization and how these methods are applied in treating liver metastases from pancreatic NETs?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively explains the concept of hepatic arterial occlusion and chemoembolization (TACE) as a treatment for liver metastases, specifically relating it to pancreatic neuroendocrine tumors (NETs).

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with AIDS-related lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma combines treatment of the lymphoma with treatment for AIDS.
                    Patients with AIDS have weakened immune systems and treatment can cause the immune system to become even weaker. For this reason, treating patients who have AIDS-related lymphoma is difficult and some patients may be treated with lower doses of drugs than lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS.    Combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) is used to lessen the damage to the immune system caused by HIV. Treatment with combined antiretroviral therapy may allow some patients with AIDS-related lymphoma to safely receive anticancer drugs in standard or higher doses. In these patients, treatment may work as well as it does in lymphoma patients who do not have AIDS. Medicine to prevent and treat infections, which can be serious, is also used.   For more information about AIDS and its treatment, please see the AIDSinfo website.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.    The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used in patients who are more likely to have lymphoma in the central nervous system (CNS).       Chemotherapy is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma. It is not yet known whether it is best to give combined antiretroviral therapy at the same time as chemotherapy or after chemotherapy ends.     Colony-stimulating factors are sometimes given together with chemotherapy. This helps lessen the side effects chemotherapy may have on the bone marrow.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.            The way the radiation therapy is given depends on where the cancer has formed. External radiation therapy is used to treat AIDS-related primary CNS lymphoma.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a way of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Monoclonal antibody therapy is a type of targeted therapy.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. These may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is used in the treatment of AIDS-related peripheral/systemic lymphoma.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

Patients with AIDS typically have compromised immunity, which complicates their treatment for lymphoma. By using cART, some patients may be able to safely receive standard or higher doses of anticancer drugs. This can enhance the treatment's effectiveness, potentially making it comparable to that of lymphoma patients without AIDS.

Moreover, because treating AIDS-related lymphoma can weaken the immune system further, cART helps maintain immune function, allowing for a better response to anticancer therapies. In addition, patients may also receive medication to prevent and treat infections, which are serious risks for those with diminished immune defenses.",310,Can you explain the role of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) during the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma and how it may impact the effectiveness of anticancer drugs?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately explains the role of combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) during the treatment of AIDS-related lymphoma, detailing how it mitigates immune damage and allows for the safe administration of anticancer drugs.

                    - There is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
                
                
                    There is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.
                    Staging is the process used to find out how far the cancer has spread. There is no standard staging system for chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms. Treatment is based on the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm the patient has. It is important to know the type in order to plan treatment.","The type of myeloproliferative neoplasm a patient may have is determined by several factors, including the following:

1. **Type of Blood Cells Produced**: The classification is based on whether there is an overproduction of red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets. For example, chronic myelogenous leukemia primarily affects white blood cells, while polycythemia vera involves excess red blood cells.

2. **Specific Conditions**: The neoplasm is classified according to specific diseases such as:
   - Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML)
   - Polycythemia vera (PV)
   - Primary myelofibrosis (PMF)
   - Essential thrombocythemia (ET)
   - Chronic neutrophilic leukemia
   - Chronic eosinophilic leukemia

3. **Presence of Abnormal Cells**: The presence of certain abnormal cells, such as blasts, and specific chromosomal changes can influence the diagnosis. For instance, the absence of the Philadelphia chromosome distinguishes myelodysplastic/myeloproliferative neoplasms from chronic myelogenous leukemia.

4. **Symptoms and Clinical Presentation**: Signs and symptoms that a patient exhibits may provide clues as to which type of myeloproliferative neoplasm they have. For example, signs like anemia or frequent infections can guide the diagnostic process.

5. **Diagnostic Tests Results**: Results from blood tests and bone marrow examinations (including complete blood count, peripheral blood smear, and bone marrow biopsy) provide critical information that helps in determining the specific type of neoplasm.

These factors help in classifying the neoplasm appropriately for treatment planning.",203,What factors determine the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm a patient may have?,PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses factors that determine the type of myeloproliferative neoplasm, which is somewhat related to the original answer's emphasis on the importance of knowing the type for treatment planning.

                    Eleven types of standard treatment are used:
                    Watchful waiting     Watchful waiting is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.        Phlebotomy      Phlebotomy is a procedure in which blood is taken from a vein. A sample of blood may be taken for tests such as a CBC or blood chemistry. Sometimes phlebotomy is used as a treatment and blood is taken from the body to remove extra red blood cells. Phlebotomy is used in this way to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.         Platelet apheresis      Platelet apheresis is a treatment that uses a special machine to remove platelets from the blood. Blood is taken from the patient and put through a blood cell separator where the platelets are removed. The rest of the blood is then returned to the patients bloodstream.       Transfusion therapy     Transfusion therapy (blood transfusion) is a method of giving red blood cells, white blood cells, or platelets to replace blood cells destroyed by disease or cancer treatment.        Chemotherapy      Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.        Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy is used to treat chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms, and is usually directed at the spleen.       Other drug therapy     Prednisone and danazol are drugs that may be used to treat anemia in patients with primary myelofibrosis.     Anagrelide therapy is used to reduce the risk of blood clots in patients who have too many platelets in their blood. Low-dose aspirin may also be used to reduce the risk of blood clots.     Thalidomide, lenalidomide, and pomalidomide are drugs that prevent blood vessels from growing into areas of tumor cells.     See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.        Surgery      Splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen) may be done if the spleen is enlarged.        Biologic therapy      Biologic therapy is a treatment that uses the patient's immune system to fight cancer or other diseases. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the body's natural defenses against disease. This type of treatment is also called biotherapy or immunotherapy. Interferon alfa and pegylated interferon alpha are biologic agents commonly used to treat some chronic myeloproliferative neoplasms.      Erythropoietic growth factors are also biologic agents. They are used to stimulate the bone marrow to make red blood cells.        Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Tyrosine kinase inhibitors are targeted therapy drugs that block signals needed for tumors to grow.      Ruxolitinib is a tyrosine kinase inhibitor used to treat certain types of myelofibrosis.    See Drugs Approved for Myeloproliferative Neoplasms for more information.    Other types of targeted therapies are being studied in clinical trials.       High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.

1. **Access to New Treatments**: Patients may have the opportunity to receive the latest treatments that are not yet widely available. Clinical trials often include new drugs or therapy approaches that could be more effective than standard treatments.

2. **Contribution to Research**: By participating in a clinical trial, patients help advance medical knowledge and contribute to research efforts aimed at improving cancer care. Even if the trial does not lead to a successful treatment for them, the information gathered may benefit future patients.

3. **Possibility of Improved Outcomes**: Some clinical trials aim to determine if new treatments can improve standard care, potentially leading to better outcomes for patients involved in the trial.

4. **Comprehensive Care**: Clinical trials often provide additional monitoring and follow-up care that might not be available outside of the trial setting, ensuring patients receive comprehensive medical attention.

5. **Potential for Standard Treatment Change**: When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, that new treatment may eventually become the standard of care, benefiting many patients in the future.

6. **Different Phases of Participation**: Patients can enter clinical trials at various stages of their treatment—before, during, or after standard therapies, giving them flexibility in their treatment options.

7. **Potential for Tailored Treatments**: Some trials may focus on specific patient characteristics, offering personalized approaches to treatment based on genetic or molecular markers relevant to the individual’s condition.

                    Prostate cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the prostate.
                    The prostate is a gland in the male reproductive system. The prostate is just below the bladder (the organ that collects and empties urine) and in front of the rectum (the lower part of the intestine). It is about the size of a walnut and surrounds part of the urethra (the tube that empties urine from the bladder). The prostate gland produces fluid that makes up part of the semen.       As men age, the prostate may get bigger. A bigger prostate may block the flow of urine from the bladder and cause problems with sexual function. This condition is called benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH). BPH is not cancer, but surgery may be needed to correct it. The symptoms of BPH or of other problems in the prostate may be like symptoms of prostate cancer.","The risk factors associated with developing prostate cancer include:

1. **Age**: Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50; the risk increases with age.
2. **Family History**: A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk.
3. **Race**: Prostate cancer occurs more frequently in African-American men compared to white men, and African-American men are also more likely to die from the disease.
4. **Hormones**: Male hormones, particularly testosterone and its derivative dihydrotestosterone (DHT), are involved in prostate development and may influence the risk of prostate cancer.
5. **Vitamin E**: Research has indicated that taking vitamin E alone may increase the risk of prostate cancer.
6. **Folic Acid**: High doses of folic acid supplements have been linked to an increased risk of prostate cancer; however, adequate intake of folate from dietary sources appears to lower the risk.
7. **Dairy and Calcium**: A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may lead to a slight increase in the risk of prostate cancer. 

These factors may increase the chances of developing prostate cancer, highlighting the importance of age, genetic predisposition, race, dietary components, and hormonal influences.",81,"What are the risk factors associated with developing prostate cancer, especially considering it is the second most common cancer among men in the United States?",PARTLY_RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses risk factors associated with prostate cancer, which is relevant to the topic of prostate cancer.

"Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.

                    There are different types of treatment for childhood vascular tumors.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with vascular tumors. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because vascular tumors in children are rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with childhood vascular tumors should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating children with cancer and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         - Pediatric vascular anomaly specialist (expert in treating children with vascular tumors).    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Orthopedic surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Social worker.
                
                
                    Some treatments cause side effects months or years after treatment has ended.
                    Some treatments, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy, cause side effects that continue or appear months or years after treatment has ended. These are called late effects. Late effects of treatment may include:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Eleven types of standard treatment are used:
                    Beta-blocker therapy     Beta-blockers are drugs that decrease blood pressure and heart rate. When used in patients with vascular tumors, beta-blockers may help shrink the tumors. Beta-blocker therapy may be given by vein (IV), by mouth, or placed on the skin (topical). The way the beta-blocker therapy is given depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor first formed.    The beta-blocker propranolol is usually the first treatment for hemangiomas. Infants treated with IV propranolol may need to have their treatment started in a hospital. Propranolol is also used to treat benign vascular tumor of liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.    Other beta-blockers used to treat vascular tumors include atenolol, nadolol, and timolol.     Infantile hemangioma may also be treated with propranolol and steroid therapy or propranolol and topical beta-blocker therapy.    See the drug information summary on Propranolol Hydrochloride for more information.       Surgery    The following types of surgery may be used to remove many types of vascular tumors:             -  Excision: Surgery to remove the entire tumor and some of the healthy tissue around it.     -  Laser surgery: A surgical procedure that uses a laser beam (a narrow beam of intense light) as a knife to make bloodless cuts in tissue or to remove a skin lesion such as a tumor. Surgery with a pulsed dye laser may be used for some hemangiomas. This type of laser uses a beam of light that targets blood vessels in the skin. The light is changed into heat and the blood vessels are destroyed without damaging nearby skin.      - Total hepatectomy and liver transplant: A surgical procedure to remove the entire liver followed by a transplant of a healthy liver from a donor.     -  Curettage: A procedure in which abnormal tissue is removed using a small, spoon-shaped instrument called a curette.           The type of surgery used depends on the type of vascular tumor and where the tumor formed in the body.    For malignant tumors, even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, some patients may be given chemotherapy or radiation therapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the tumor will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Photocoagulation     Photocoagulation is the use of an intense beam of light, such as a laser, to seal off blood vessels or destroy tissue. It is used to treat pyogenic granuloma.       Embolization     Embolization is a procedure that uses particles, such as tiny gelatin sponges or beads, to block blood vessels in the liver. It may be used to treat some benign vascular tumors of the liver and kaposiform hemangioendothelioma.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach tumor cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect tumor cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Chemotherapy for hemangiomas may also be given topically (applied to the skin in a cream or lotion).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated.       Sclerotherapy     Sclerotherapy is a treatment used to destroy the blood vessel with the tumor. A liquid is injected into the blood vessel, causing it to scar and break down. Over time, the destroyed blood vessel is absorbed into normal tissue. The blood flows through nearby healthy veins instead. Sclerotherapy is used in the treatment of epithelioid hemangioma.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill tumor cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:             -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the tumor.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the tumor.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of the vascular tumor being treated. External radiation is used to treat some vascular tumors.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack specific tumor cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Angiogenesis inhibitors are a type of targeted therapy.            - Angiogenesis inhibitors are drugs that stop cells from dividing and prevent the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow. The targeted therapy drugs thalidomide, sorafenib, pazopanib, sirolimus, and bevacizumab are angiogenesis inhibitors used to treat childhood vascular tumors.              Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight disease. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against disease.     Interferon is a type of immunotherapy used to treat childhood vascular tumors. It interferes with the division of tumor cells and can slow tumor growth. It is used in the treatment of juvenile nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, kaposiform hemangioendothelioma, and epithelioid hemangioendothelioma.       Other drug therapy    Other drugs used to treat childhood vascular tumors or manage their effects include the following:            -  Steroid therapy: Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Steroid drugs help shrink some vascular tumors.     -  Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs): NSAIDs are commonly used to decrease fever, swelling, pain, and redness. Examples of NSAIDs are aspirin, ibuprofen, and naproxen. In the treatment of vascular tumors, NSAIDs can increase the flow of blood through the tumors and decrease the chance that an unwanted blood clot will form.      -  Antifibrinolytic therapy: These drugs help the blood clot in patients who have Kasabach-Merritt syndrome. Fibrin is the main protein in a blood clot that helps stop bleeding and heal wounds. Some vascular tumors cause fibrin to break down and the patient's blood does not clot normally, causing uncontrolled bleeding. Antifibrinolytics help prevent the breakdown of fibrin.               Observation     Observation is closely monitoring a patients condition without giving any treatment until signs or symptoms appear or change.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way disease will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose tumors have not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop tumors from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the vascular tumor may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the tumor has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.","The surgical techniques used to treat childhood vascular tumors vary significantly depending on the type of tumor and its location in the body. For instance, the following surgical methods may be employed:

1. **Excision**: This technique involves the surgical removal of the entire vascular tumor along with some surrounding healthy tissue. It is typically used for tumors where complete removal is feasible.

2. **Laser Surgery**: Utilizes a laser beam to make precise cuts in tissue or to remove tumors, often employed for superficial tumors like certain hemangiomas, minimizing damage to the surrounding tissue.

3. **Total Hepatectomy with Liver Transplant**: Applied when benign vascular tumors of the liver are involved and necessitate complete liver removal, followed by transplantation to restore liver function.

4. **Curettage**: Involves scraping away the abnormal tissue, which may be appropriate for some surface tumors like pyogenic granulomas.

The specific choice of surgical technique is influenced by factors such as whether the tumor is benign or malignant, its size, its exact location (e.g., on the skin, in organs like the liver, or deeper tissues like muscle), and the potential for complete resection without affecting adjacent critical structures. Additionally, for malignant tumors, follow-up treatments like chemotherapy or radiation may be necessary post-surgery to address any residual cancer cells and reduce recurrence risks.",567,How do the different surgical techniques used to treat childhood vascular tumors vary depending on the type of tumor and its location?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately addresses the question regarding the variation in surgical techniques for childhood vascular tumors based on tumor type and location.

Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with ALL should have their treatment planned by a team of doctors who are experts in treating childhood leukemia.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health professionals who are experts in treating children with leukemia and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    -  Hematologist.    -  Medical oncologist.    -  Pediatric surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Neurologist.    -  Pathologist.    -  Radiologist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Psychologist.    -  Child-life specialist.
                
                
                    Children and adolescents may have treatment-related side effects that appear months or years after treatment for acute lymphoblastic leukemia.
                    Regular follow-up exams are very important. Treatment can cause side effects long after it has ended. These are called late effects.   Late effects of cancer treatment may include:         - Physical problems, including problems with the heart, blood vessels, liver, or bones, and fertility. When dexrazoxane is given with chemotherapy drugs called anthracyclines, the risk of late heart effects is lessened.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory. Children younger than 4 years who have received radiation therapy to the brain have a higher risk of these effects.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer) or other conditions, such as brain tumors, thyroid cancer, acute myeloid leukemia, and myelodysplastic syndrome.        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the possible late effects caused by some treatments. See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer.
                
                
                    The treatment of childhood ALL usually has three phases.
                    The treatment of childhood ALL is done in phases:         -  Remission induction: This is the first phase of treatment. The goal is to kill the leukemia cells in the blood and bone marrow. This puts the leukemia into remission.     -  Consolidation /intensification: This is the second phase of treatment. It begins once the leukemia is in remission. The goal of consolidation/intensification therapy is to kill any leukemia cells that remain in the body and may cause a relapse.    -  Maintenance: This is the third phase of treatment. The goal is to kill any remaining leukemia cells that may regrow and cause a relapse. Often the cancer treatments are given in lower doses than those used during the remission induction and consolidation/intensification phases. Not taking medication as ordered by the doctor during maintenance therapy increases the chance the cancer will come back. This is also called the continuation therapy phase.
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is treatment using more than one anticancer drug.     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the child's risk group. Children with high-risk ALL receive more anticancer drugs and higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL. Intrathecal chemotherapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord.    See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type of cancer being treated. External radiation therapy may be used to treat childhood ALL that has spread, or may spread, to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles. It may also be used to prepare the bone marrow for a stem cell transplant.       Chemotherapy with stem cell transplant    Stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and sometimes total-body irradiation, and then replacing the blood-forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of a donor. After the patient receives treatment, the donor's stem cells are given to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the patient's blood cells. The stem cell donor doesn't have to be related to the patient.    Stem cell transplant is rarely used as initial treatment for children and adolescents with ALL. It is used more often as part of treatment for ALL that relapses (comes back after treatment).    See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.        Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to identify and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells.      Tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs) are targeted therapy drugs that block the enzyme, tyrosine kinase, which causes stem cells to become more white blood cells or blasts than the body needs. Imatinib mesylate is a TKI used in the treatment of children with Philadelphia chromosome positive ALL. Dasatinib and ruxolitinib are TKIs that are being studied in the treatment of newly diagnosed high-risk ALL.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Blinatumomab and inotuzumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied in the treatment of refractory childhood ALL.    New kinds of targeted therapies are also being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL.    See Drugs Approved for Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia for more information.
                
                
                    Treatment is given to kill leukemia cells that have spread or may spread to the brain, spinal cord, or testicles.
                    Treatment to kill leukemia cells or prevent the spread of leukemia cells to the brain and spinal cord (central nervous system; CNS) is called CNS-directed therapy. Chemotherapy may be used to treat leukemia cells that have spread, or may spread, to the brain and spinal cord. Because standard doses of chemotherapy may not reach leukemia cells in the CNS, the cells are able to hide in the CNS. Systemic chemotherapy given in high doses or intrathecal chemotherapy (into the cerebrospinal fluid) is able to reach leukemia cells in the CNS. Sometimes external radiation therapy to the brain is also given.    These treatments are given in addition to treatment that is used to kill leukemia cells in the rest of the body. All children with ALL receive CNS-directed therapy as part of induction therapy and consolidation/intensification therapy and sometimes during maintenance therapy.    If the leukemia cells spread to the testicles, treatment includes high doses of systemic chemotherapy and sometimes radiation therapy.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy     CAR T-cell therapy is a type of immunotherapy that changes the patient's T cells (a type of immune system cell) so they will attack certain proteins on the surface of cancer cells. T cells are taken from the patient and special receptors are added to their surface in the laboratory. The changed cells are called chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T cells. The CAR T cells are grown in the laboratory and given to the patient by infusion. The CAR T cells multiply in the patient's blood and attack cancer cells. CAR T-cell therapy is being studied in the treatment of childhood ALL that has relapsed (come back) a second time.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.    Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy is done during all phases of treatment to see how well the treatment is working.

                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors form from germ cells in parts of the body other than the brain.
                    A germ cell is a type of cell that forms as a fetus (unborn baby) develops. These cells later become sperm in the testicles or eggs in the ovaries. Sometimes while the fetus is forming, germ cells travel to parts of the body where they should not be and grow into a germ cell tumor. The tumor may form before or after birth.   This summary is about germ cell tumors that form in parts of the body that are extracranial (outside the brain). Extracranial germ cell tumors usually form in the following areas of the body:          - Testicles.    - Ovaries.    -  Sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine).    - Retroperitoneum (the back wall of the abdomen).    -  Mediastinum (area between the lungs).               Extracranial germ cell tumors are most common in adolescents 15 to 19 years of age.   See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for information on intracranial (inside the brain) germ cell tumors.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign or malignant.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors may be benign (noncancer) or malignant (cancer).
                
                
                    There are three types of extracranial germ cell tumors.
                    Extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped into mature teratomas, immature teratomas, and malignant germ cell tumors:      Mature Teratomas     Mature teratomas are the most common type of extracranial germ cell tumor. Mature teratomas are benign tumors and not likely to become cancer. They usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or in the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. The cells of mature teratomas look almost like normal cells under a microscope. Some mature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Immature Teratomas     Immature teratomas also usually occur in the sacrum or coccyx (bottom part of the spine) in newborns or the ovaries of girls at the start of puberty. Immature teratomas have cells that look very different from normal cells under a microscope. Immature teratomas may be cancer. They often have several different types of tissue in them, such as hair, muscle, and bone. Some immature teratomas release enzymes or hormones that cause signs and symptoms of disease.       Malignant Germ Cell Tumors     Malignant germ cell tumors are cancer. There are two main types of malignant germ cell tumors:            - Germinomas: Tumors that make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). There are three types of germinomas.                  -  Dysgerminomas form in the ovary in girls.       -  Seminomas form in the testicle in boys.       - Germinomas form in areas of the body that are not the ovary or testicle.                - Nongerminomas: There are four types of nongerminomas.                  - Yolk sac tumors make a hormone called alpha-fetoprotein (AFP). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Choriocarcinomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG). They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.       -  Embryonal carcinomas may make a hormone called -hCG and/or a hormone called AFP. They can form in the testicle or other parts of the body, but not in the ovary.       - Mixed germ cell tumors are made up of both malignant germ cell tumor and teratoma. They can form in the ovary, testicle, or other areas of the body.
                
                
                    Childhood extracranial germ cell tumors are grouped as gonadal or extragonadal.
                    Malignant extracranial germ cell tumors are gonadal or extragonadal.     Gonadal Germ Cell Tumors    Gonadal germ cell tumors form in the testicles in boys or ovaries in girls.          Testicular Germ Cell Tumors        Testicular germ cell tumors are divided into two main types, seminoma and nonseminoma.               - Seminomas make a hormone called beta-human chorionic gonadotropin (-hCG).      - Nonseminomas are usually large and cause signs or symptoms. They tend to grow and spread more quickly than seminomas.              Testicular germ cell tumors usually occur before the age of 4 years or in adolescents and young adults. Testicular germ cell tumors in adolescents and young adults are different from those that form in early childhood.     Boys older than 14 years with testicular germ cell tumors are treated in pediatric cancer centers, but the treatment is much like the treatment used in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Testicular Cancer Treatment for more information.)             Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors        Ovarian germ cell tumors are more common in adolescent girls and young women. Most ovarian germ cell tumors are benign teratomas. Sometimes immature teratomas, dysgerminomas, yolk sac tumors, and mixed germ cell tumors (cancer) occur. (See the PDQ summary on Ovarian Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information.)          Extragonadal Extracranial Germ Cell Tumors    Extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form in areas other than the brain, testicles, or ovaries.    Most extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors form along the midline of the body. This includes the following:             - Sacrum (the large, triangle-shaped bone in the lower spine that forms part of the pelvis).     -  Coccyx (the small bone at the bottom of the spine, also called the tailbone).     -  Mediastinum (the area between the lungs).     -  Back of the abdomen.     -  Neck.           In younger children, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors usually occur at birth or in early childhood. Most of these tumors are teratomas in the sacrum or coccyx.    In older children, adolescents, and young adults, extragonadal extracranial germ cell tumors are often in the mediastinum.","Factors that might increase the risk of developing childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, particularly concerning inherited disorders, include:

Examples of protective factors for breast cancer include:

1. **Less exposure to estrogen** made by the body, which can occur through:
   - **Early pregnancy**: Women who have a full-term pregnancy before age 20 have a lower risk compared to those who have children later or do not have children at all.
   - **Breastfeeding**: Women who breastfeed may have a lower risk of breast cancer.

2. **Hormonal treatments**:
   - **Estrogen-only hormone therapy** after a hysterectomy can reduce breast cancer risk for women who have undergone this surgery.
   - **Selective estrogen receptor modulators (SERMs)**, such as tamoxifen and raloxifene, can lower the risk of breast cancer in certain women.

3. **Aromatase inhibitors**: These medications decrease estrogen production and lower the risk of recurrence or new breast cancers in women with a history of breast cancer.

4. **Risk-reducing surgical options**:
   - **Risk-reducing mastectomy**: The removal of both breasts when there are no signs of cancer significantly lowers the risk.
   - **Oophorectomy (removal of ovaries)** which reduces estrogen levels can also lower breast cancer risk in high-risk women.

5. **Ovarian ablation**: This involves treatments that stop or reduce estrogen production by the ovaries.

6. **Regular exercise**: Engaging in sufficient physical activity, such as exercising four or more hours a week, is associated with a lower risk of breast cancer.

                    After renal cell cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if renal cell cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually cancerous renal cells. The disease is metastatic renal cell cancer, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for renal cell cancer:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found only in the kidney.       Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is larger than 7 centimeters and is found only in the kidney.        Stage III    In stage III:            - the tumor is any size and cancer is found only in the kidney and in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes; or      - cancer is found in the main blood vessels of the kidney or in the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney. Cancer may be found in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - beyond the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney and may be found in the adrenal gland above the kidney with cancer, or in nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other organs, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain, and may have spread to lymph nodes.","The symptoms and treatment strategies for renal cell cancer are significantly impacted by the stage of the cancer at diagnosis.

**Symptoms**:
- Early stages (Stage I and II) of renal cell cancer may present fewer or more vague symptoms, such as blood in the urine and a lump in the abdomen. As the disease progresses to higher stages (Stage III and IV), symptoms may become more pronounced due to the cancer's spread beyond the kidney, potentially affecting nearby lymph nodes or distant organs.

**Treatment Strategies**:
- **Stage I**: Treatment often includes surgery, such as a radical or partial nephrectomy. If surgery is not possible, palliative interventions like radiation therapy or arterial embolization may be used.
  
- **Stage II**: Similar to Stage I, surgery is a primary treatment option, often radical nephrectomy or partial nephrectomy. Palliative measures may be employed for non-surgical candidates.

- **Stage III**: Treatment typically involves surgery (radical nephrectomy) with potential removal of affected lymph nodes. Palliative radiation therapy may also be utilized to manage symptoms. 

- **Stage IV**: At this advanced stage, treatment may include surgery, but there is a focus on targeted therapy, biologic therapy, and chemotherapy. Palliative care becomes increasingly important to manage symptoms and improve quality of life.

In summary, the stage of renal cell cancer not only influences the severity of symptoms but also dictates the treatment options available, leading to a more aggressive approach as the cancer progresses.",386,In what ways are the symptoms and treatment strategies impacted by the stage of renal cell cancer at diagnosis?,NON_RELEVANT,"The generated answer discusses symptoms and treatment strategies based on the stage of renal cell cancer, while the original answer primarily focuses on the processes of staging, cancer spread, and the classification of stages.

                    Penile cancer is a disease in which malignant (cancer) cells form in the tissues of the penis.
                    The penis is a rod-shaped male reproductive organ that passes sperm and urine from the body. It contains two types of erectile tissue (spongy tissue with blood vessels that fill with blood to make an erection):          - Corpora cavernosa: The two columns of erectile tissue that form most of the penis.    -  Corpus spongiosum: The single column of erectile tissue that forms a small portion of the penis. The corpus spongiosum surrounds the urethra (the tube through which urine and sperm pass from the body).        The erectile tissue is wrapped in connective tissue and covered with skin. The glans (head of the penis) is covered with loose skin called the foreskin.","To confirm the presence of penile cancer, several diagnostic tests are typically performed. These tests primarily focus on examining the penis. The following procedures may be used:

1. **Physical Exam and History**: This involves examining the body to check for general signs of health and any unusual findings on the penis, such as lumps or sores. A medical history of the patient is also taken into account.

                    The salivary glands make saliva and release it into the mouth. Saliva has enzymes that help digest food and antibodies that help protect against infections of the mouth and throat. There are 3 pairs of major salivary glands:         - Parotid glands: These are the largest salivary glands and are found in front of and just below each ear. Most major salivary gland tumors begin in this gland.    - Sublingual glands: These glands are found under the tongue in the floor of the mouth.    - Submandibular glands: These glands are found below the jawbone.         There are also hundreds of small (minor) salivary glands lining parts of the mouth, nose, and larynx that can be seen only with a microscope. Most small salivary gland tumors begin in the palate (roof of the mouth).   More than half of all salivary gland tumors are benign (not cancerous) and do not spread to other tissues.     Salivary gland cancer is a type of head and neck cancer.","Common signs and symptoms associated with salivary gland cancer that patients should be aware of include:

The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - Whether there are any cancer cells left after surgery.    - The type of tumor.    - Where the tumor is in the body.    - The child's age.    - Whether the tumor has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).,"The type of tumor significantly influences the recovery outlook for children diagnosed with brain or spinal cord tumors. The prognosis, or chance of recovery, is affected by several factors, including the type of tumor (benign or malignant). Malignant tumors are more likely to grow quickly and spread, which generally leads to a poorer prognosis compared to benign tumors that grow slowly and do not spread. Additionally, other factors contributing to the prognosis include whether there are any cancer cells left after surgery, the location of the tumor in the body, the child's age, and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or has recurred. Therefore, understanding the type of tumor plays a crucial role in assessing the overall recovery outlook for affected children.",244,How does the type of tumor influence the recovery outlook for children diagnosed with brain or spinal cord tumors?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question regarding how the type of tumor influences the recovery outlook while incorporating key factors mentioned in the original answer, such as the presence of cancer cells after surgery, tumor location, child's age, and whether the tumor is newly diagnosed or recurrent.

                    After renal cell cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread within the kidney or to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:          -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if renal cell cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually cancerous renal cells. The disease is metastatic renal cell cancer, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for renal cell cancer:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is 7 centimeters or smaller and is found only in the kidney.       Stage II    In stage II, the tumor is larger than 7 centimeters and is found only in the kidney.        Stage III    In stage III:            - the tumor is any size and cancer is found only in the kidney and in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes; or      - cancer is found in the main blood vessels of the kidney or in the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney. Cancer may be found in 1 or more nearby lymph nodes.              Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread:            - beyond the layer of fatty tissue around the kidney and may be found in the adrenal gland above the kidney with cancer, or in nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other organs, such as the lungs, liver, bones, or brain, and may have spread to lymph nodes.","The transition from stage IV renal cell cancer to earlier stages is primarily defined by the presence of metastasis. In stage IV, cancer has spread beyond the layer of fatty tissue surrounding the kidney and may affect:

1. Nearby organs, such as the adrenal gland above the kidney and nearby lymph nodes.
2. Distant organs including the lungs, liver, bones, or brain, and it may involve lymph nodes.

In contrast, earlier stages (I, II, and III) are characterized by cancer that is confined to the kidney or localized areas, such as nearby lymph nodes or blood vessels, without any distant spread. Specifically:

- **Stage I** involves a tumor that is 7 centimeters or smaller, found only in the kidney.
- **Stage II** has a tumor larger than 7 centimeters, still confined to the kidney.
- **Stage III** may involve cancer that is any size but is only found in the kidney and in one or more nearby lymph nodes, or affecting surrounding structures like the main blood vessels of the kidney or the fatty tissue around it.

Thus, the main criterion for defining stage IV renal cell cancer compared to earlier stages is the occurrence of metastasis to other organs or lymph nodes.",386,"What criteria define the transition from stage IV renal cell cancer compared to the earlier stages, particularly in terms of metastasis?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the criteria that define stage IV renal cell cancer compared to earlier stages. It closely aligns with the original answer by detailing the concept of metastasis and comparing stage IV to stages I, II, and III, including the specific characteristics of each stage.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with primary CNS lymphoma.
                    Different types of treatment are available for patients with primary central nervous system (CNS) lymphoma. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment. Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.     Surgery is not used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.
                
                
                    Three standard treatments are used:
                    Radiation therapy      Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer. Because primary CNS lymphoma spreads throughout the brain, external radiation therapy is given to the whole brain. This is called whole brain radiation therapy.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on whether the patient has primary CNS lymphoma and AIDS. External radiation therapy is used to treat primary CNS lymphoma.     High-dose radiation therapy to the brain can damage healthy tissue and cause disorders that can affect thinking, learning, problem solving, speech, reading, writing, and memory. Clinical trials have tested the use of chemotherapy alone or before radiation therapy to reduce the damage to healthy brain tissue that occurs with the use of radiation therapy.       Chemotherapy     Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid (intrathecal chemotherapy), an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy).     The way the chemotherapy is given depends on where the tumor is in the CNS or eye. Primary CNS lymphoma may be treated with systemic chemotherapy, intrathecal chemotherapy and/or intraventricular chemotherapy, in which anticancer drugs are placed into the ventricles (fluid -filled cavities) of the brain. If primary CNS lymphoma is found in the eye, anticancer drugs are injected directly into the vitreous humor (jelly-like substance) inside the eye.     A network of blood vessels and tissue, called the blood-brain barrier, protects the brain from harmful substances. This barrier can also keep anticancer drugs from reaching the brain. In order to treat CNS lymphoma, certain drugs may be used to make openings between cells in the blood-brain barrier. This is called blood-brain barrier disruption. Anticancer drugs infused into the bloodstream may then reach the brain.         Steroid therapy     Steroids are hormones made naturally in the body. They can also be made in a laboratory and used as drugs. Glucocorticoids are steroid drugs that have an anticancer effect in lymphomas.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant     High-dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplant is a method of giving high doses of chemotherapy and replacing blood -forming cells destroyed by the cancer treatment. Stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient or a donor and are frozen and stored. After the chemotherapy is completed, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.       Targeted therapy     Targeted therapy is a type of treatment that uses drugs or other substances to attack cancer cells. Targeted therapies usually cause less harm to normal cells than chemotherapy or radiation therapy do. Monoclonal antibody therapy is one type of targeted therapy being studied in the treatment of primary CNS lymphoma.    Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Rituximab is a type of monoclonal antibody used to treat newly diagnosed primary CNS lymphoma in patients who do not have AIDS.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

                    After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body.
                    After breast cancer has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread within the breast or to other parts of the body. This process is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment. Breast cancer in men is staged the same as it is in women. The spread of cancer from the breast to lymph nodes and other parts of the body appears to be similar in men and women.   The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Sentinel lymph node biopsy : The removal of the sentinel lymph node during surgery. The sentinel lymph node is the first lymph node to receive lymphatic drainage from a tumor. It is the first lymph node the cancer is likely to spread to from the tumor. A radioactive substance and/or blue dye is injected near the tumor. The substance or dye flows through the lymph ducts to the lymph nodes. The first lymph node to receive the substance or dye is removed. A pathologist views the tissue under a microscope to look for cancer cells. If cancer cells are not found, it may not be necessary to remove more lymph nodes.     -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.     -   Bone scan : A procedure to check if there are rapidly dividing cells, such as cancer cells, in the bone. A very small amount of radioactive material is injected into a vein and travels through the bloodstream. The radioactive material collects in the bones and is detected by a scanner.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if breast cancer spreads to the bone, the cancer cells in the bone are actually breast cancer cells. The disease is metastatic breast cancer, not bone cancer.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for male breast cancer:
                    This section describes the stages of breast cancer. The breast cancer stage is based on the results of testing that is done on the tumor and lymph nodes removed during surgery and other tests.     Stage 0 (carcinoma in situ)    There are 3 types of breast carcinoma in situ:            -  Ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is a noninvasive condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lining of a breast duct. The abnormal cells have not spread outside the duct to other tissues in the breast. In some cases, DCIS may become invasive cancer and spread to other tissues. At this time, there is no way to know which lesions could become invasive.     -  Paget disease of the nipple is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the nipple only.      -  Lobular carcinoma in situ (LCIS) is a condition in which abnormal cells are found in the lobules of the breast. This condition has not been seen in men.               Stage I     In stage I, cancer has formed. Stage I is divided into stages IA and IB.            - In stage IA, the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer has not spread outside the breast.     - In stage IB, small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes and either:                  - no tumor is found in the breast; or       - the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.                         Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA                   - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - the tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                - In stage IIB, the tumor is:                  - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or        - larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy); or        - larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.                          Stage IIIA    In stage IIIA:            - no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer is found in 4 to 9 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during imaging tests or a physical exam); or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes; or      - the tumor is larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has spread to 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or to the lymph nodes near the breastbone (found during a sentinel lymph node biopsy).               Stage IIIB    In stage IIIB, the tumor may be any size and cancer has spread to the chest wall and/or to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer. Also, cancer may have spread to :            - up to 9 axillary lymph nodes; or     - the lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.       Stage IIIC    In stage IIIC, no tumor is found in the breast or the tumor may be any size. Cancer may have spread to the skin of the breast and caused swelling or an ulcer and/or has spread to the chest wall. Also, cancer has spread to:             - 10 or more axillary lymph nodes; or     -  lymph nodes above or below the collarbone; or     - axillary lymph nodes and lymph nodes near the breastbone.           Cancer that has spread to the skin of the breast may also be inflammatory breast cancer. See the section on Inflammatory Male Breast Cancer for more information.    For treatment, stage IIIC breast cancer is divided into operable and inoperable stage IIIC.        Stage IV    In stage IV, cancer has spread to other organs of the body, most often the bones, lungs, liver, or brain.","The specific differences between stage I and stage II male breast cancer regarding tumor size and lymph node involvement are as follows:

**Stage I:**
- **Stage IA:** The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller, and cancer has not spread outside the breast.
- **Stage IB:** Small clusters of breast cancer cells (larger than 0.2 millimeter but not larger than 2 millimeters) are found in the lymph nodes, and either:
  - No tumor is found in the breast, or
  - The tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller.

**Stage II:**
- **Stage IIA:** 
  - No tumor is found in the breast, or the tumor is 2 centimeters or smaller. Cancer (larger than 2 millimeters) is found in 1 to 3 axillary lymph nodes or in the lymph nodes near the breastbone; or
  - The tumor is larger than 2 centimeters but not larger than 5 centimeters. Cancer has not spread to the lymph nodes.

                    There are different types of treatment for patients with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone.
                    Different types of treatment are available for children with osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH) of bone. Some treatments are standard (the currently used treatment), and some are being tested in clinical trials. A treatment clinical trial is a research study meant to help improve current treatments or obtain information on new treatments for patients with cancer. When clinical trials show that a new treatment is better than the standard treatment, the new treatment may become the standard treatment.   Because cancer in children is rare, taking part in a clinical trial should be considered. Some clinical trials are open only to patients who have not started treatment.
                
                
                    Children with osteosarcoma or MFH should have their treatment planned by a team of health care providers who are experts in treating cancer in children.
                    Treatment will be overseen by a pediatric oncologist, a doctor who specializes in treating children with cancer. The pediatric oncologist works with other pediatric health care providers who are experts in treating osteosarcoma and MFH and who specialize in certain areas of medicine. These may include the following specialists:         -  Pediatrician.    - Orthopedic surgeon.    -  Radiation oncologist.    -  Rehabilitation specialist.    -  Pediatric nurse specialist.    -  Social worker.    -  Psychologist.
                
                
                    Treatment for osteosarcoma or malignant fibrous histiocytoma may cause side effects.
                    For information about side effects that begin during treatment for cancer, see our Side Effects page.   Side effects from cancer treatment that begin after treatment and continue for months or years are called late effects. Late effects of cancer treatment may include the following:         - Physical problems.    - Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory.    -  Second cancers (new types of cancer).        Some late effects may be treated or controlled. It is important to talk with your child's doctors about the effects cancer treatment can have on your child. (See the PDQ summary on Late Effects of Treatment for Childhood Cancer for more information).
                
                
                    Four types of standard treatment are used:
                    Surgery     Surgery to remove the entire tumor will be done when possible. Chemotherapy may be given before surgery to make the tumor smaller. This is called neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Chemotherapy is given so less bone tissue needs to be removed and there are fewer problems after surgery.     The following types of surgery may be done:            -  Wide local excision: Surgery to remove the cancer and some healthy tissue around it.     -  Limb-sparing surgery: Removal of the tumor in a limb (arm or leg) without amputation, so the use and appearance of the limb is saved. Most patients with osteosarcoma in a limb can be treated with limb-sparing surgery. The tumor is removed by wide local excision. Tissue and bone that are removed may be replaced with a graft using tissue and bone taken from another part of the patient's body, or with an implant such as artificial bone. If a fracture is found at diagnosis or during chemotherapy before surgery, limb-sparing surgery may still be possible in some cases. If the surgeon is not able to remove all of the tumor and enough healthy tissue around it, an amputation may be done.     -  Amputation: Surgery to remove part or all of an arm or leg. This may be done when it is not possible to remove all of the tumor in limb-sparing surgery. The patient may be fitted with a prosthesis (artificial limb) after amputation.     -  Rotationplasty: Surgery to remove the tumor and the knee joint. The part of the leg that remains below the knee is then attached to the part of the leg that remains above the knee, with the foot facing backward and the ankle acting as a knee. A prosthesis may then be attached to the foot.           Studies have shown that survival is the same whether the first surgery done is a limb-sparing surgery or an amputation.    Even if the doctor removes all the cancer that can be seen at the time of the surgery, patients are also given chemotherapy after surgery to kill any cancer cells that are left in the area where the tumor was removed or that have spread to other parts of the body. Treatment given after the surgery, to lower the risk that the cancer will come back, is called adjuvant therapy.       Chemotherapy    Chemotherapy is a cancer treatment that uses drugs to stop the growth of cancer cells, either by killing the cells or by stopping them from dividing. When chemotherapy is taken by mouth or injected into a vein or muscle, the drugs enter the bloodstream and can reach cancer cells throughout the body (systemic chemotherapy). When chemotherapy is placed directly into the cerebrospinal fluid, an organ, or a body cavity such as the abdomen, the drugs mainly affect cancer cells in those areas (regional chemotherapy). Combination chemotherapy is the use of more than one anticancer drug. The way the chemotherapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    In the treatment of osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytosis of bone, chemotherapy is usually given before and after surgery to remove the primary tumor.    See Drugs Approved for Bone Cancer for more information.       Radiation therapy     Radiation therapy is a cancer treatment that uses high-energy x-rays or other types of radiation to kill cancer cells or keep them from growing. There are two types of radiation therapy:            -  External radiation therapy uses a machine outside the body to send radiation toward the cancer.     -  Internal radiation therapy uses a radioactive substance sealed in needles, seeds, wires, or catheters that are placed directly into or near the cancer.           The way the radiation therapy is given depends on the type and stage of the cancer being treated.    Osteosarcoma and MFH cells are not killed easily by external radiation therapy. It may be used when a small amount of cancer is left after surgery or used together with other treatments.       Samarium     Samarium is a radioactive drug that targets areas where bone cells are growing, such as tumor cells in bone. It helps relieve pain caused by cancer in the bone and it also kills blood cells in the bone marrow. It also is used to treat osteosarcoma that has come back after treatment in a different bone.    Treatment with samarium may be followed by stem cell transplant. Before treatment with samarium, stem cells (immature blood cells) are removed from the blood or bone marrow of the patient and are frozen and stored. After treatment with samarium is complete, the stored stem cells are thawed and given back to the patient through an infusion. These reinfused stem cells grow into (and restore) the body's blood cells.
                
                
                    New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Targeted therapy      Targeted therapy is a treatment that uses drugs or other substances to find and attack specific cancer cells without harming normal cells. Kinase inhibitor therapy and monoclonal antibody therapy are types of targeted therapy being studied in clinical trials for osteosarcoma.     Kinase inhibitor therapy blocks a protein needed for cancer cells to divide. Sorafenib is a type of kinase inhibitor therapy being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma.     Monoclonal antibody therapy is a cancer treatment that uses antibodies made in the laboratory, from a single type of immune system cell. These antibodies can identify substances on cancer cells or normal substances that may help cancer cells grow. The antibodies attach to the substances and kill the cancer cells, block their growth, or keep them from spreading. Monoclonal antibodies are given by infusion. They may be used alone or to carry drugs, toxins, or radioactive material directly to cancer cells. Denosumab, dinutuximab, and glembatumumab are monoclonal antibodies being studied for the treatment of recurrent osteosarcoma.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.
                
                
                    Follow-up tests may be needed.
                    Some of the tests that were done to diagnose the cancer or to find out the stage of the cancer may be repeated. Some tests will be repeated in order to see how well the treatment is working. Decisions about whether to continue, change, or stop treatment may be based on the results of these tests.   Some of the tests will continue to be done from time to time after treatment has ended. The results of these tests can show if your child's condition has changed or if the cancer has recurred (come back). These tests are sometimes called follow-up tests or check-ups.

**During Treatment:**
1. **Surgery**: Side effects may include pain, infection, and complications from anesthesia. Depending on the type of surgery, there may also be impacts on physical function or appearance (e.g., amputation).
   
2. **Chemotherapy**: Common side effects include nausea, vomiting, fatigue, hair loss, and increased risk of infections due to lowered white blood cell counts. Chemotherapy can also affect the body’s overall ability to heal.

3. **Radiation Therapy**: Potential side effects include skin irritation, fatigue, and inflammation of the tissues in the area being treated. It’s important to note that osteosarcoma and MFH cells are not easily killed by radiation, so this may be used selectively.

4. **Samarium**: Treatment with samarium might cause side effects such as pain, as it targets areas of bone and can affect blood cell production in the bone marrow. This may lead to anemia or increased risk of bleeding.

**After Treatment:**
Late effects from treatments may arise and can include:
- **Physical problems**: These might encompass issues related to mobility, strength, or pain. 
- **Changes in mood, feelings, thinking, learning, or memory**: These cognitive and psychological effects may persist long after treatment has ended.
- **Second cancers**: There is a risk of developing new types of cancer related to the treatments received.

It is crucial for patients and families to discuss these potential side effects with their healthcare team to manage and address them effectively. Follow-up care and monitoring may be necessary to detect and manage any late effects that arise after the primary treatment has concluded.",94,"Can you explain the potential side effects of treatments for osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, both during and after the treatment process?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer thoroughly addresses the potential side effects of treatments for osteosarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma, aligning closely with the original answer's key points.

"Key Points
                    Past treatment for cancer and certain genetic conditions affect the risk of having childhood ALL. Anything that increases your risk of getting a disease is called a risk factor. Having a risk factor does not mean that you will get cancer; not having risk factors doesnt mean that you will not get cancer. Talk with your child's doctor if you think your child may be at risk.    Possible risk factors for ALL include the following:         - Being exposed to x-rays before birth.    - Being exposed to radiation.    - Past treatment with chemotherapy.    - Having certain genetic conditions, such as:               -  Down syndrome.      -  Neurofibromatosis type 1.      -  Bloom syndrome.      -  Fanconi anemia.      -  Ataxia-telangiectasia.      -  Li-Fraumeni syndrome.      - Constitutional mismatch repair deficiency (mutations in certain genes that stop DNA from repairing itself, which leads to the growth of cancers at an early age).             - Having certain changes in the chromosomes or genes.
                       
                
                    Risk Groups
                    - In childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.    - Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated.
                
                
                
                    In childhood ALL, risk groups are used to plan treatment.
                    There are three risk groups in childhood ALL. They are described as:         - Standard (low) risk: Includes children aged 1 to younger than 10 years who have a white blood cell count of less than 50,000/L at the time of diagnosis.    - High risk: Includes children 10 years and older and/or children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/L or more at the time of diagnosis.    - Very high risk: Includes children younger than age 1, children with certain changes in the genes, children who have a slow response to initial treatment, and children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment.        Other factors that affect the risk group include the following:         - Whether the leukemia cells began from B lymphocytes or T lymphocytes.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes or genes of the lymphocytes.    - How quickly and how low the leukemia cell count drops after initial treatment.    - Whether leukemia cells are found in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis.        It is important to know the risk group in order to plan treatment. Children with high-risk or very highrisk ALL usually receive more anticancer drugs and/or higher doses of anticancer drugs than children with standard-risk ALL.
                
                
                
                    Relapsed childhood ALL is cancer that has come back after it has been treated.
                    The leukemia may come back in the blood and bone marrow, brain, spinal cord, testicles, or other parts of the body.    Refractory childhood ALL is cancer that does not respond to treatment.","Factors that contribute to categorizing a child into the high-risk or very high-risk groups for childhood Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia (ALL) include:

**High Risk:**
- Children aged 10 years and older.
- Children who have a white blood cell count of 50,000/L or more at the time of diagnosis.

**Very High Risk:**
- Children younger than age 1.
- Children who have certain changes in the genes.
- Children who show a slow response to initial treatment.
- Children who have signs of leukemia after the first 4 weeks of treatment.

Additional factors influencing risk group classification include:
- The origin of leukemia cells (B lymphocytes vs. T lymphocytes).
- Genetic or chromosomal changes in the lymphocytes.
- The rate at which the leukemia cell count decreases after initial treatment.
- The presence of leukemia cells in the cerebrospinal fluid at the time of diagnosis.

Children in high-risk or very high-risk groups typically receive more intensive treatment compared to those in the standard-risk group.",556,What factors contribute to categorizing a child into the high-risk or very high-risk groups for childhood ALL?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately outlines the factors that categorize children into high-risk and very high-risk groups for childhood ALL, mirroring the details provided in the original answer.

"Certain factors affect treatment options and prognosis (chance of recovery). The treatment options may depend on the following:         - The number of hairy (leukemia) cells and healthy blood cells in the blood and bone marrow.    - Whether the spleen is swollen.    - Whether there are signs or symptoms of leukemia, such as infection.    - Whether the leukemia has recurred (come back) after previous treatment.        The prognosis (chance of recovery) depends on the following:         - Whether the hairy cell leukemia does not grow or grows so slowly it does not need treatment.    - Whether the hairy cell leukemia responds to treatment.        Treatment often results in a long-lasting remission (a period during which some or all of the signs and symptoms of the leukemia are gone). If the leukemia returns after it has been in remission, retreatment often causes another remission.","The presence of a swollen spleen in patients diagnosed with Hairy Cell Leukemia is a significant factor that influences treatment decisions. Specifically, whether the spleen is swollen can affect prognosis and treatment options. In cases where the blood cell counts are not too low and there are no signs or symptoms, patients may not need immediate treatment and can be monitored. However, if blood cell counts become too low or if there are signs or symptoms (including a swollen spleen), initial treatment may include chemotherapy or a splenectomy (surgery to remove the spleen). This indicates that the treatment approach may vary depending on the condition of the spleen and its impact on the patient's overall health.",618,How does the presence of swollen spleen correlate with the treatment decisions for patients diagnosed with Hairy Cell Leukemia?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer effectively addresses the correlation between the presence of a swollen spleen and treatment decisions for patients with Hairy Cell Leukemia, which is in line with the original answer's discussion of factors affecting treatment options. It elaborates on how the condition of the spleen impacts treatment choices and prognosis, providing a detailed and relevant response."
Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options for primary brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following:         - The type and grade of the tumor.    -  Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord.    - Whether the tumor can be removed by surgery.    - Whether cancer cells remain after surgery.    - Whether there are certain changes in the chromosomes.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).    - The patient's general health.        The prognosis and treatment options for metastatic brain and spinal cord tumors depend on the following:         - Whether there are more than two tumors in the brain or spinal cord.    - Where the tumor is in the brain or spinal cord.    - How well the tumor responds to treatment.    - Whether the primary tumor continues to grow or spread.,"The presence of multiple tumors in the brain or spinal cord affects the treatment approach for metastatic cases by making the prognosis and treatment options more complex. Specifically, treatment considerations include the number of tumors present, their locations, and the extent of disease spread. Metastatic tumors that form more than two in the brain or spinal cord may lead to different therapeutic strategies, reflecting the need for potentially more aggressive treatment or a nuanced approach to managing multiple sites of disease. This is because multiple tumors can indicate a more advanced stage of cancer, which may require a combination of treatments such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy to effectively manage the disease and improve outcomes.",316,How does the presence of multiple tumors in the brain or spinal cord affect the treatment approach for metastatic cases?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer addresses the impact of multiple tumors on the treatment approach for metastatic cases, which aligns with the original answer's discussion on factors affecting prognosis and treatment options for metastatic tumors.

                    Childhood craniopharyngiomas are benign brain tumors found near the pituitary gland.
                    Childhood craniopharyngiomas are rare tumors usually found near the pituitary gland (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands) and the hypothalamus (a small cone-shaped organ connected to the pituitary gland by nerves).     Craniopharyngiomas are usually part solid mass and part fluid -filled cyst. They are benign (not cancer) and do not spread to other parts of the brain or to other parts of the body. However, they may grow and press on nearby parts of the brain or other areas, including the pituitary gland, the optic chiasm, optic nerves, and fluid-filled spaces in the brain. Craniopharyngiomas may affect many functions of the brain. They may affect hormone making, growth, and vision. Benign brain tumors need treatment.    This summary is about the treatment of primary brain tumors (tumors that begin in the brain). Treatment for metastatic brain tumors, which are tumors formed by cancer cells that begin in other parts of the body and spread to the brain, is not covered in this summary. See the PDQ treatment summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for information about the different types of childhood brain and spinal cord tumors.   Brain tumors can occur in both children and adults; however, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults.

                    Avoiding risk factors and increasing protective factors may help prevent cancer.
                    Avoiding cancer risk factors may help prevent certain cancers. Risk factors include smoking, being overweight, and not getting enough exercise. Increasing protective factors such as quitting smoking and exercising may also help prevent some cancers. Talk to your doctor or other health care professional about how you might lower your risk of cancer.
                
                
                    The following risk factors may increase the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Age      Prostate cancer is rare in men younger than 50 years of age. The chance of developing prostate cancer increases as men get older.       Family history of prostate cancer     A man whose father, brother, or son has had prostate cancer has a higher-than-average risk of prostate cancer.       Race     Prostate cancer occurs more often in African-American men than in white men. African-American men with prostate cancer are more likely to die from the disease than white men with prostate cancer.       Hormones    The prostate needs male hormones to work the way it should. The main male sex hormone is testosterone. Testosterone helps the body develop and maintain male sex characteristics.    Testosterone is changed into dihydrotestosterone (DHT) by an enzyme in the body. DHT is important for normal prostate growth but can also cause the prostate to get bigger and may play a part in the development of prostate cancer.       Vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) found that vitamin E taken alone increased the risk of prostate cancer. The risk continued even after the men stopped taking vitamin E.       Folic acid    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid. However, the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets.       Dairy and calcium    A diet high in dairy foods and calcium may cause a small increase in the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    The following protective factors may decrease the risk of prostate cancer:
                    Folate    Folate is a kind of vitamin B that occurs naturally in some foods, such as green vegetables, beans and orange juice. Folic acid is a man-made form of folate that is found in vitamin supplements and fortified foods, such as whole-grain breads and cereals. A 10-year study showed that the risk of prostate cancer was lower in men who had enough folate in their diets. However, the risk of prostate cancer was increased in men who took 1 milligram (mg) supplements of folic acid.       Finasteride and Dutasteride     Finasteride and dutasteride are drugs used to lower the amount of male sex hormones made by the body. These drugs block the enzyme that changes testosterone into dihydrotestosterone (DHT). Higher than normal levels of DHT may play a part in developing prostate cancer. Taking finasteride or dutasteride has been shown to lower the risk for prostate cancer, but it is not known if these drugs lower the risk of death from prostate cancer.    The Prostate Cancer Prevention Trial (PCPT) studied whether the drug finasteride can prevent prostate cancer in healthy men 55 years of age and older. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men that took finasteride compared with the group of men that did not. Also, the men who took finasteride who did have prostate cancer had more aggressive tumors. The number of deaths from prostate cancer was the same in both groups. Men who took finasteride reported more side effects compared with the group of men that did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, and enlarged breasts.    The Reduction by Dutasteride of Prostate Cancer Events Trial (REDUCE) studied whether the drug dutasteride can prevent prostate cancer in men aged 50 to 75 years at higher risk for the disease. This prevention study showed there were fewer prostate cancers in the group of men who took dutasteride compared with the group of men that did not. The number of less aggressive prostate cancers was lower, but the number of more aggressive prostate cancers was not. Men who took dutasteride reported more side effects than men who did not, including erectile dysfunction, loss of desire for sex, less semen, and gynecomastia (enlarged breasts).
                
                
                    The following have been proven not to affect the risk of prostate cancer, or their effects on prostate cancer risk are not known:
                    Selenium and vitamin E    The Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial (SELECT) studied whether taking vitamin E and selenium (a mineral) will prevent prostate cancer. The selenium and vitamin E were taken separately or together by healthy men 55 years of age and older (50 years of age and older for African-American men). The study showed that taking selenium alone or selenium and vitamin E together did not decrease the risk of prostate cancer.       Diet    It is not known if decreasing fat or increasing fruits and vegetables in the diet helps decrease the risk of prostate cancer or death from prostate cancer. In the PCPT trial, certain fatty acids increased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer while others decreased the risk of high-grade prostate cancer.       Multivitamins    Regular use of multivitamins has not been proven to increase the risk of early or localized prostate cancer. However, a large study showed an increased risk of advanced prostate cancer among men who took multivitamins more than seven times a week.       Lycopene    Some studies have shown that a diet high in lycopene may be linked to a decreased risk of prostate cancer, but other studies have not. It has not been proven that taking lycopene supplements decreases the risk of prostate cancer.
                
                
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to prevent cancer.
                    Cancer prevention clinical trials are used to study ways to lower the risk of developing certain types of cancer. Some cancer prevention trials are conducted with healthy people who have not had cancer but who have an increased risk for cancer. Other prevention trials are conducted with people who have had cancer and are trying to prevent another cancer of the same type or to lower their chance of developing a new type of cancer. Other trials are done with healthy volunteers who are not known to have any risk factors for cancer.    The purpose of some cancer prevention clinical trials is to find out whether actions people take can prevent cancer. These may include eating fruits and vegetables, exercising, quitting smoking, or taking certain medicines, vitamins, minerals, or food supplements.
                
                
                    New ways to prevent prostate cancer are being studied in clinical trials.
                    Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. Information about clinical trials can be found in the Clinical Trials section of the NCI website. Check NCI's list of cancer clinical trials for prostate cancer prevention trials that are accepting patients.","To reduce your risk factors for developing prostate cancer, especially considering age and family history, you can consider the following lifestyle changes:

1. **Maintain a Healthy Weight**: Being overweight is a known risk factor for prostate cancer, so managing your weight through a balanced diet and regular exercise can be beneficial.

2. **Engage in Regular Physical Activity**: Getting enough exercise helps maintain a healthy weight and may reduce the risk of prostate cancer.

3. **Avoid Smoking**: Smoking is associated with various health risks, including cancer. Quitting smoking can improve overall health and potentially lower cancer risks.

4. **Dietary Considerations**:
   - Increase your intake of folate, which is found in foods like green vegetables, beans, and orange juice. Studies suggest that having enough folate in your diet may decrease the risk of prostate cancer.
   - Limit the intake of dairy and calcium, as a diet high in these has been associated with a slight increase in prostate cancer risk.

5. **Consult with Healthcare Professionals**: Since you have a family history of prostate cancer, it's crucial to discuss your risks with your doctor, who may recommend regular screening or preventive measures like medications (e.g., finasteride or dutasteride) which have been shown to lower prostate cancer risk.

Implementing these changes may help you lower your risk of developing prostate cancer in the context of your age and family history.",83,"What lifestyle changes can I make to reduce my risk factors for developing prostate cancer, considering age and family history?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer aligns well with the original answer by providing actionable lifestyle changes to reduce the risk factors for prostate cancer, particularly considering age and family history. It references key points such as maintaining a healthy weight, engaging in physical activity, avoiding smoking, dietary considerations regarding folate and dairy, and the importance of consulting healthcare professionals, all of which are directly supported by the information in the original answer."
"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    This summary section describes treatments that are being studied in clinical trials. It may not mention every new treatment being studied. Information about clinical trials is available from the NCI website.     Immunotherapy     Immunotherapy is a treatment that uses the patients immune system to fight cancer. Substances made by the body or made in a laboratory are used to boost, direct, or restore the bodys natural defenses against cancer. This type of cancer treatment is also called biotherapy or biological therapy.     Vaccine therapy uses a substance to stimulate the immune system to destroy a tumor. Vaccine therapy is being studied to treat neuroblastoma that has come back after treatment.       Other drug therapy     Lenalidomide is a type of angiogenesis inhibitor. It prevents the growth of new blood vessels that are needed by a tumor to grow.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","New treatments for neuroblastoma currently being studied in clinical trials include:

1. **Immunotherapy**: This treatment utilizes the patient's immune system to fight cancer. Vaccine therapy, which stimulates the immune system to destroy tumors, is being studied specifically for neuroblastoma that has returned after initial treatment.

2. **Other Drug Therapy**: Lenalidomide is an angiogenesis inhibitor that is being evaluated in clinical trials. It works by preventing the growth of new blood vessels that tumors need to grow.

3. **Monoclonal Antibody Therapy**: Combination of monoclonal antibody therapy (such as dinutuximab) with other treatments is being examined for its effectiveness in treating recurrent neuroblastoma.

4. **Targeted Therapy**: An example of targeted therapy being studied is the antibody-drug conjugate, lorvotuzumab mertansine, which specifically targets cancer cells.

These new treatments differ from existing therapies, such as standard chemotherapy and radiation, by focusing on modifying the immune response or targeting specific processes critical for the cancer's growth, potentially reducing harm to normal cells and improving effectiveness against resistant cancer cells. Additionally, they provide options for patients when traditional therapies may not be effective or appropriate, especially in recurrent cases.",126,"What types of new treatments for Neuroblastoma are currently being studied in clinical trials, and how do they differ from existing therapies?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer directly addresses the question about new treatments for neuroblastoma being studied in clinical trials. It includes specific types of treatments such as immunotherapy, other drug therapy, and mentions vaccine therapy, which are all relevant to the original answer.

                    An adult central nervous system tumor is a disease in which abnormal cells form in the tissues of the brain and/or spinal cord.
                    There are many types of brain and spinal cord tumors. The tumors are formed by the abnormal growth of cells and may begin in different parts of the brain or spinal cord. Together, the brain and spinal cord make up the central nervous system (CNS).   The tumors may be either benign (not cancer) or malignant (cancer):         - Benign brain and spinal cord tumors grow and press on nearby areas of the brain. They rarely spread into other tissues and may recur (come back).     - Malignant brain and spinal cord tumors are likely to grow quickly and spread into other brain tissue.         When a tumor grows into or presses on an area of the brain, it may stop that part of the brain from working the way it should. Both benign and malignant brain tumors cause signs and symptoms and need treatment.   Brain and spinal cord tumors can occur in both adults and children. However, treatment for children may be different than treatment for adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain and Spinal Cord Tumors Treatment Overview for more information on the treatment of children.)   For information about lymphoma that begins in the brain, see the PDQ summary on Primary CNS Lymphoma Treatment.
                
                
                    A tumor that starts in another part of the body and spreads to the brain is called a metastatic brain tumor.
                    Tumors that start in the brain are called primary brain tumors. Primary brain tumors may spread to other parts of the brain or to the spine. They rarely spread to other parts of the body.   Often, tumors found in the brain have started somewhere else in the body and spread to one or more parts of the brain. These are called metastatic brain tumors (or brain metastases). Metastatic brain tumors are more common than primary brain tumors.    Up to half of metastatic brain tumors are from lung cancer. Other types of cancer that commonly spread to the brain include:         -  Melanoma.    -  Breast cancer.    -  Colon cancer.    -  Kidney cancer.    -  Nasopharyngeal cancer.    -  Cancer of unknown primary site.        Cancer may spread to the leptomeninges (the two innermost membranes covering the brain and spinal cord). This is called leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. The most common cancers that spread to the leptomeninges include:         -  Breast cancer.    - Lung cancer.    -  Leukemia.    -  Lymphoma.        See the following for more information from PDQ about cancers that commonly spread to the brain or spinal cord:         -  Adult Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Adult Non-Hodgkin Lymphoma Treatment     -  Breast Cancer Treatment     -  Carcinoma of Unknown Primary Treatment     -  Colon Cancer Treatment     -  Leukemia Home Page     -  Melanoma Treatment     -  Nasopharyngeal Cancer Treatment     -  Non-Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment     -  Renal Cell Cancer Treatment     -  Small Cell Lung Cancer Treatment
                
                
                    The brain controls many important body functions.
                    The brain has three major parts:          - The cerebrum is the largest part of the brain. It is at the top of the head. The cerebrum controls thinking, learning, problem solving, emotions, speech, reading, writing, and voluntary movement.     - The cerebellum is in the lower back of the brain (near the middle of the back of the head). It controls movement, balance, and posture.     - The brain stem connects the brain to the spinal cord. It is in the lowest part of the brain (just above the back of the neck). The brain stem controls breathing, heart rate, and the nerves and muscles used to see, hear, walk, talk, and eat.
                
                
                    The spinal cord connects the brain to nerves in most parts of the body.
                    The spinal cord is a column of nerve tissue that runs from the brain stem down the center of the back. It is covered by three thin layers of tissue called membranes. These membranes are surrounded by the vertebrae (back bones). Spinal cord nerves carry messages between the brain and the rest of the body, such as a message from the brain to cause muscles to move or a message from the skin to the brain to feel touch.
                
                
                    There are different types of brain and spinal cord tumors.
                    Brain and spinal cord tumors are named based on the type of cell they formed in and where the tumor first formed in the CNS. The grade of a tumor may be used to tell the difference between slow-growing and fast-growing types of the tumor. The World Health Organization (WHO) tumor grades are based on how abnormal the cancer cells look under a microscope and how quickly the tumor is likely to grow and spread.      WHO Tumor Grading System       - Grade I (low-grade)  The tumor cells look more like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread more slowly than grade II, III, and IV tumor cells. They rarely spread into nearby tissues. Grade I brain tumors may be cured if they are completely removed by surgery.    - Grade II  The tumor cells grow and spread more slowly than grade III and IV tumor cells. They may spread into nearby tissue and may recur (come back). Some tumors may become a higher-grade tumor.    - Grade III  The tumor cells look very different from normal cells under a microscope and grow more quickly than grade I and II tumor cells. They are likely to spread into nearby tissue.    - Grade IV (high-grade)  The tumor cells do not look like normal cells under a microscope and grow and spread very quickly. There may be areas of dead cells in the tumor. Grade IV tumors usually cannot be cured.        The following types of primary tumors can form in the brain or spinal cord:     Astrocytic Tumors    An astrocytic tumor begins in star-shaped brain cells called astrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An astrocyte is a type of glial cell. Glial cells sometimes form tumors called gliomas. Astrocytic tumors include the following:            -  Brain stem glioma (usually high grade): A brain stem glioma forms in the brain stem, which is the part of the brain connected to the spinal cord. It is often a high-grade tumor, which spreads widely through the brain stem and is hard to cure. Brain stem gliomas are rare in adults. (See the PDQ summary on Childhood Brain Stem Glioma Treatment for more information.)     -  Pineal astrocytic tumor (any grade): A pineal astrocytic tumor forms in tissue around the pineal gland and may be any grade. The pineal gland is a tiny organ in the brain that makes melatonin, a hormone that helps control the sleeping and waking cycle.      -  Pilocytic astrocytoma (grade I): A pilocytic astrocytoma grows slowly in the brain or spinal cord. It may be in the form of a cyst and rarely spreads into nearby tissues. Pilocytic astrocytomas can often be cured.      -  Diffuse astrocytoma (grade II): A diffuse astrocytoma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, a diffuse astrocytoma can be cured. It is also called a low-grade diffuse astrocytoma.      -  Anaplastic astrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic astrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. An anaplastic astrocytoma is also called a malignant astrocytoma or high-grade astrocytoma.      -  Glioblastoma (grade IV): A glioblastoma grows and spreads very quickly. The tumor cells look very different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured. It is also called glioblastoma multiforme.            See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about astrocytomas in children.       Oligodendroglial Tumors    An oligodendroglial tumor begins in brain cells called oligodendrocytes, which help keep nerve cells healthy. An oligodendrocyte is a type of glial cell. Oligodendrocytes sometimes form tumors called oligodendrogliomas. Grades of oligodendroglial tumors include the following:            -  Oligodendroglioma (grade II): An oligodendroglioma grows slowly, but often spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligodendroglioma can be cured.      -  Anaplastic oligodendroglioma (grade III): An anaplastic oligodendroglioma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually cannot be cured.             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about oligodendroglial tumors in children.       Mixed Gliomas    A mixed glioma is a brain tumor that has two types of tumor cells in it  oligodendrocytes and astrocytes. This type of mixed tumor is called an oligoastrocytoma.            -  Oligoastrocytoma (grade II): An oligoastrocytoma is a slow-growing tumor. The tumor cells look something like normal cells. In some cases, an oligoastrocytoma can be cured.     -  Anaplastic oligoastrocytoma (grade III): An anaplastic oligoastrocytoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor has a worse prognosis than oligoastrocytoma (grade II).             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Astrocytomas Treatment for more information about mixed gliomas in children.       Ependymal Tumors    An ependymal tumor usually begins in cells that line the fluid -filled spaces in the brain and around the spinal cord. An ependymal tumor may also be called an ependymoma. Grades of ependymomas include the following:            -  Ependymoma (grade I or II): A grade I or II ependymoma grows slowly and has cells that look something like normal cells. There are two types of grade I ependymoma  myxopapillary ependymoma and subependymoma. A grade II ependymoma grows in a ventricle (fluid-filled space in the brain) and its connecting paths or in the spinal cord. In some cases, a grade I or II ependymoma can be cured.     -  Anaplastic ependymoma (grade III): An anaplastic ependymoma grows quickly and spreads into nearby tissues. The tumor cells look different from normal cells. This type of tumor usually has a worse prognosis than a grade I or II ependymoma.             See the PDQ summary on Childhood Ependymoma Treatment for more information about ependymoma in children.       Medulloblastomas    A medulloblastoma is a type of embryonal tumor. Medulloblastomas are most common in children or young adults.      See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about medulloblastomas in children.       Pineal Parenchymal Tumors     A pineal parenchymal tumor forms in parenchymal cells or pineocytes, which are the cells that make up most of the pineal gland. These tumors are different from pineal astrocytic tumors. Grades of pineal parenchymal tumors include the following:            -  Pineocytoma (grade II): A pineocytoma is a slow-growing pineal tumor.     -  Pineoblastoma (grade IV): A pineoblastoma is a rare tumor that is very likely to spread.            See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Embryonal Tumors Treatment for more information about pineal parenchymal tumors in children.       Meningeal Tumors    A meningeal tumor, also called a meningioma, forms in the meninges (thin layers of tissue that cover the brain and spinal cord). It can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells. Meningiomas are most common in adults. Types of meningeal tumors include the following:            -  Meningioma (grade I): A grade I meningioma is the most common type of meningeal tumor. A grade I meningioma is a slow-growing tumor. It forms most often in the dura mater. A grade I meningioma can be cured if it is completely removed by surgery.     -  Meningioma (grade II and III): This is a rare meningeal tumor. It grows quickly and is likely to spread within the brain and spinal cord. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.            A hemangiopericytoma is not a meningeal tumor but is treated like a grade II or III meningioma. A hemangiopericytoma usually forms in the dura mater. The prognosis is worse than a grade I meningioma because the tumor usually cannot be completely removed by surgery.        Germ Cell Tumors    A germ cell tumor forms in germ cells, which are the cells that develop into sperm in men or ova (eggs) in women. There are different types of germ cell tumors. These include germinomas, teratomas, embryonal yolk sac carcinomas, and choriocarcinomas. Germ cell tumors can be either benign or malignant.     See the PDQ summary on Childhood Central Nervous System Germ Cell Tumors Treatment for more information about childhood germ cell tumors in the brain.       Craniopharyngioma (Grade I)    A craniopharyngioma is a rare tumor that usually forms in the center of the brain just above the pituitary gland (a pea-sized organ at the bottom of the brain that controls other glands). Craniopharyngiomas can form from different types of brain or spinal cord cells.     See the PDQ summary on Childhood Craniopharyngioma Treatment for more information about craniopharyngioma in children.","Primary brain tumors and metastatic brain tumors differ fundamentally in their origin and implications for treatment.

**Primary Brain Tumors**: These tumors originate within the brain or spinal cord from the abnormal growth of cells. In children, primary brain tumors are common types of cancer affecting this population. The treatment for primary tumors may involve a combination of surgery, radiation therapy, chemotherapy, and emerging treatments tested in clinical trials. Each case is tailored based on the type of tumor, its location, and the child's overall health.

**Metastatic Brain Tumors**: In contrast, metastatic tumors form when cancer cells from other parts of the body spread to the brain or spinal cord. The treatment focus for metastatic tumors typically includes addressing the primary cancer site along with the brain metastases, which may involve systematic chemotherapy, targeted therapy, and radiation. Treatment decisions will rely on the nature of the original cancer and compliance with systemic therapies.

Overall, while both types of tumors necessitate a treatment plan developed by a specialized medical team, the approach and focus differ significantly due to their distinct origins.",311,"What are the differences between primary brain tumors and metastatic brain tumors, and how do they affect treatment options?",RELEVANT,"The generated answer accurately describes the differences between primary brain tumors and metastatic brain tumors, aligning closely with the information provided in the original answer.

                    After intraocular melanoma has been diagnosed, tests are done to find out if cancer cells have spread to other parts of the body.
                    The process used to find out if cancer has spread to other parts of the body is called staging. The information gathered from the staging process determines the stage of the disease. It is important to know the stage in order to plan treatment.    The following tests and procedures may be used in the staging process:         -   Blood chemistry studies : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by organs and tissues in the body. An unusual (higher or lower than normal) amount of a substance can be a sign of disease.     -   Liver function tests : A procedure in which a blood sample is checked to measure the amounts of certain substances released into the blood by the liver. A higher than normal amount of a substance can be a sign the cancer has spread to the liver.    -   Ultrasound exam: A procedure in which high-energy sound waves (ultrasound) are bounced off internal tissues or organs, such as the liver, and make echoes. The echoes form a picture of body tissues called a sonogram.    -   Chest x-ray : An x-ray of the organs and bones inside the chest. An x-ray is a type of energy beam that can go through the body and onto film, making a picture of areas inside the body.    -   MRI (magnetic resonance imaging): A procedure that uses a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to make a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body. This procedure is also called nuclear magnetic resonance imaging (NMRI).    -   CT scan (CAT scan): A procedure that makes a series of detailed pictures of areas inside the body, such as the chest, abdomen, or pelvis, taken from different angles. The pictures are made by a computer linked to an x-ray machine. A dye may be injected into a vein or swallowed to help the organs or tissues show up more clearly. This procedure is also called computed tomography, computerized tomography, or computerized axial tomography.    -   PET scan (positron emission tomography scan): A procedure to find malignant tumor cells in the body. A very small amount of radioactive glucose (sugar) is injected into a vein. The PET scanner rotates around the body and makes a picture of where glucose is being used in the body. Malignant tumor cells show up brighter in the picture because they are more active and take up more glucose than normal cells do. Sometimes a PET scan and a CT scan are done at the same time. If there is any cancer, this increases the chance that it will be found.
                
                
                    The following sizes are used to describe intraocular melanoma:
                    Small    The tumor is 5 to 16 millimeters in diameter and from 1 to 3 millimeters thick.           Medium    The tumor is 16 millimeters or smaller in diameter and from 3.1 to 8 millimeters thick.       Large    The tumor is:            - more than 8 millimeters thick and any diameter; or     - at least 2 millimeters thick and more than 16 millimeters in diameter.            Though most intraocular melanoma tumors are raised, some are flat. These diffuse tumors grow widely across the uvea.
                
                
                    There are three ways that cancer spreads in the body.
                    Cancer can spread through tissue, the lymph system, and the blood:         - Tissue. The cancer spreads from where it began by growing into nearby areas.     - Lymph system. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the lymph system. The cancer travels through the lymph vessels to other parts of the body.     - Blood. The cancer spreads from where it began by getting into the blood. The cancer travels through the blood vessels to other parts of the body.
                
                
                    Cancer may spread from where it began to other parts of the body.
                    When cancer spreads to another part of the body, it is called metastasis. Cancer cells break away from where they began (the primary tumor) and travel through the lymph system or blood.         - Lymph system. The cancer gets into the lymph system, travels through the lymph vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.    - Blood. The cancer gets into the blood, travels through the blood vessels, and forms a tumor (metastatic tumor) in another part of the body.        The metastatic tumor is the same type of cancer as the primary tumor. For example, if intraocular melanoma spreads to the liver, the cancer cells in the liver are actually intraocular melanoma cells. The disease is metastatic intraocular melanoma, not liver cancer.
                
                
                    There are two staging systems for intraocular melanoma.
                    Intraocular melanoma has two staging systems. The staging system used depends on where in the eye the cancer first formed:         -  Iris.    -  Ciliary body and choroid.         If intraocular melanoma spreads to the optic nerve or nearby tissue of the eye socket, it is called extraocular extension.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the iris:
                    Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is in the iris only and is not more than one fourth the size of the iris.       Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA, the tumor:                   - is in the iris only and is more than one fourth the size of the iris; or       - is in the iris only and has caused glaucoma; or       - has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both. The tumor has caused glaucoma.                - In stage IIB, the tumor has spread next to and/or into the ciliary body, choroid, or both, and has also spread into the sclera. The tumor has caused glaucoma.              Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA and IIIB.            - In stage IIIA, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick.     - In stage IIIB, the tumor has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick.              Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread:            - to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.
                
                
                    The following stages are used for intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid:
                    Intraocular melanoma of the ciliary body and choroid is grouped into four size categories. The category depends on how wide and thick the tumor is. Category 1 tumors are the smallest and category 4 tumors are the biggest.   Category 1:         - The tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 9 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick.        Category 2:         - The tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and not more than 3 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is not more than 12 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick.        Category 3:         - The tumor is 15.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 3.1 to 6 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 12.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 6.1 to 9 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 3.1 to 18 millimeters wide and 9.1 to 12 millimeters thick; or    - the tumor is 9.1 to 15 millimeters wide and 12.1 to 15 millimeters thick.

Stage I    In stage I, the tumor is size category 1 and is in the choroid only.       Stage II     Stage II is divided into stages IIA and IIB.            - In stage IIA, the tumor:                   - is size category 1 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 1 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 2 and is in the choroid only.                - In stage IIB, the tumor:                  - is size category 2 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and is in the choroid only.                         Stage III     Stage III is divided into stages IIIA, IIIB, and IIIC.            - In stage IIIA, the tumor:                  - is size category 2 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor may have spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 3 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has not spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 4 and is in the choroid only.                - In stage IIIB, the tumor:                  - is size category 3 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 4 and has spread to the ciliary body; or       - is size category 4 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has not spread to the ciliary body.                - In stage IIIC, the tumor:                  - is size category 4 and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is not more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has spread to the ciliary body; or       - may be any size and has spread through the sclera to the outside of the eyeball. The part of the tumor outside the eyeball is more than 5 millimeters thick. The tumor has not spread to the ciliary body.                         Stage IV    In stage IV, the tumor may be any size and has spread:            - to nearby lymph nodes; or     - to other parts of the body, such as the liver, lung, or bone, or to areas under the skin.","The key tests and procedures involved in the staging process for intraocular melanoma after diagnosis include:

1. **Blood Chemistry Studies**: This procedure checks a blood sample to measure certain substances that may indicate disease.
   
2. **Liver Function Tests**: A blood sample is checked to measure substances released by the liver, where abnormalities can suggest cancer spread.
   
3. **Ultrasound Exam**: High-energy sound waves are used to create images of internal tissues, particularly of the liver, to detect any abnormalities.
   
4. **Chest X-ray**: An X-ray of the chest to visualize the organs and bones and check for any spread of cancer.
   
5. **MRI (Magnetic Resonance Imaging)**: Utilizes a magnet, radio waves, and a computer to create detailed images of internal areas, helping identify potential metastasis.
   
6. **CT Scan (Computed Tomography)**: Produces detailed images of areas inside the body such as the chest and abdomen, sometimes using contrast dye.
   
7. **PET Scan (Positron Emission Tomography)**: This procedure detects malignant tumor cells by injecting a small amount of radioactive glucose, which highlights active cancer cells in the body.

"New types of treatment are being tested in clinical trials.
                    Information about ongoing clinical trials is available from the NCI website.
                
                
                    Patients may want to think about taking part in a clinical trial.
                    For some patients, taking part in a clinical trial may be the best treatment choice. Clinical trials are part of the cancer research process. Clinical trials are done to find out if new cancer treatments are safe and effective or better than the standard treatment.   Many of today's standard treatments for cancer are based on earlier clinical trials. Patients who take part in a clinical trial may receive the standard treatment or be among the first to receive a new treatment.   Patients who take part in clinical trials also help improve the way cancer will be treated in the future. Even when clinical trials do not lead to effective new treatments, they often answer important questions and help move research forward.
                
                
                    Patients can enter clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment.
                    Some clinical trials only include patients who have not yet received treatment. Other trials test treatments for patients whose cancer has not gotten better. There are also clinical trials that test new ways to stop cancer from recurring (coming back) or reduce the side effects of cancer treatment.   Clinical trials are taking place in many parts of the country. See the Treatment Options section that follows for links to current treatment clinical trials. These have been retrieved from NCI's listing of clinical trials.","Patients can participate in clinical trials before, during, or after starting their cancer treatment. There are trials specifically for patients who have not yet received treatment, as some clinical trials only include these patients.

"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The stage of the cancer (the size of the tumor and whether it is in the breast only or has spread to lymph nodes or other places in the body).    - The type of breast cancer.    - Estrogen receptor and progesterone receptor levels in the tumor tissue.    - Human epidermal growth factor type 2 receptor (HER2/neu) levels in the tumor tissue.    - Whether the tumor tissue is triple negative (cells that do not have estrogen receptors, progesterone receptors, or high levels of HER2/neu).    - How fast the tumor is growing.    - How likely the tumor is to recur (come back).    - A womans age, general health, and menopausal status (whether a woman is still having menstrual periods).    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).","Estrogen and progesterone receptor levels in a tumor significantly impact the prognosis and treatment options for breast cancer. Higher levels of these hormone receptors in tumor tissue generally indicate a better chance of recovery, as these tumors are often more responsive to hormone therapies. In contrast, tumors lacking these receptors (known as ""triple negative"" tumors) may have a poorer prognosis and fewer treatment options, as they do not respond to hormone treatments. Essentially, the presence of estrogen and progesterone receptors in breast cancer cases is an important factor in evaluating the likelihood of recovery and tailoring appropriate therapeutic strategies.",693,In what ways do estrogen and progesterone receptor levels in a tumor affect the chances of recovery from breast cancer?,RELEVANT,"The generated answer closely addresses the role of estrogen and progesterone receptor levels in determining the prognosis and treatment options for breast cancer, which aligns with the factors outlined in the original answer. It elaborates on how these levels impact recovery chances and informs on therapeutic strategies, directly tying back to the aspects mentioned in the original response."
"Certain factors affect prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options. The prognosis (chance of recovery) and treatment options depend on the following:         - The type of germ cell tumor.    - Where the tumor first began to grow.    - The stage of the cancer (whether it has spread to nearby areas or to other places in the body).    - How well the tumor responds to treatment (lower AFP and -hCG levels).    - Whether the tumor can be completely removed by surgery.    - The patient's age and general health.    - Whether the cancer has just been diagnosed or has recurred (come back).        The prognosis for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, especially ovarian germ cell tumors, is good.","The significance of a patient's age and general health when evaluating their chances of recovery from a childhood extracranial germ cell tumor lies in their direct impact on prognosis and treatment options. Specifically, younger patients may have different tumor characteristics and responses to treatment compared to older adolescents. Additionally, a patient's overall health can determine their ability to tolerate various treatments and recover from surgery or chemotherapy.

The prognosis for childhood extracranial germ cell tumors, particularly for ovarian germ cell tumors, is generally good, but it is affected by factors such as the type of tumor, its stage, and how well it responds to treatment.
